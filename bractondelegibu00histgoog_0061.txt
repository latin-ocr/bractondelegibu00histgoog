PEDlGREE OF THE Mannscawrs

starts a chapter. That sort of capital is seen near the bottom of the page in
the D of Dictum (chapter X of V). In other wordS, there was not only no
new book at this point in OA’s exemplar, but not even a new chapter. If
there had been, the scribe would have leit the usual indented space for the
capital C as he did below for the capital D. At a later time some one, a
rubricator probably, wrote the bold Liber Secundus at the top of the page, and
in the margin made the redundant, though ornamented‚ C for which no space
had been leit in the text area.¹ Definitely‚ therefore, OA tells us two things
here-that the text might be taken from one model and the scheme of
division from another, and that some manuscripts made the close connection
between the end of chapter eight and the beginning of chapter nine which we
heve noticed already. The authority of the “better” manuscripts turns out to
be the authority of a single line, or rather of the direct ancestor of that line.
Nor are we allowed to suppose that this progenitor was Bracton’s own copy of
his work. MA, ΜΒ, ΜΝ, are related to OB, ΜΙ, etc, but the common
father of them all isat least one manuscript generation earlier than the codex
which first had all the long rubrics. It is probably even further removed. OB
and LG, together with LF, have come from an ancestor in which a whole
quire of the text was lacking. ΜΙ, which also has the long rubrics at the
beginning of new books, has not OB’s lacuna in the text, though it is nearer
to OB than to MA. MN and ΜΒ have no schemes of division by books, but
MA—with MD which is very closely related to it-has its second and third
books at places different from those chosen by OB. Thus even among codices
coming from a common ancestry there are decided differences in extemal
arrangement. If the whims of individnal copyists or correctors are to be seen
in altered text and variant readings, much more clearly are they to be
discemed in the contradictory schemes of divisional adjustment. Whence
comes all this diversity in the manuscripts as to the proper way of dividing and
subdividing the De Legibus? Here are some forty different codices with
almost half as many different schemes of division. Which one of them shall
we choose as being Bracton’s owni The answer must be that heis not
responsible for the making of any one of them. It is inconceivable that such
tremendous differences should ever have developed if there had been a single
model to begin with; dissimilarity so extensive practically precludes the
