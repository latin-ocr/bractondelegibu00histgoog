THE ADDICIONES

reproducing the marginalia in an assumed original will be seen from what
follows,

The inevitable question, of course, is asto where OA got its marginal
passages if not from some exemplar close to Bracton’s own copy. This same,
or a similar, question might be asked of any one of the manuscripts which
have marginalia In regard to none of them could a definite answer be
given. But in the case of OA, while it is not necessary to trace the origin of
its marginalia to another definite source in order to prove that they did not
come from the original copy of the treatise, it is well to suggest probabilities
or possibilities. We know that OA was copied in a scriptorium, and
probably, though not necessarily, from more than a single exemplar. At any
rate, different portions of the text represent different traditions, the later part
being distinctly poorer than the first. By its quire scheme it shows itself to
be connected with some of the manuscripts which have a changed order of
subjects. The changing around of certain blocks of text in some of them
suggests that other manuscripts besides ΟΑ were written in the same
scriptorium at about the same time. Among them are manuscripts which
have either themselves been derived from more than a single model or come
from an exemplar so derived. Their peculiarities are such that an explanation
of them practically demands that we assume that several manuscripts were
copied in a single scriptorium to which two or more texts of the De Legibus,
representing different traditions, had been brought to serve as models. The

most likely guess as to the reason for 0A’s very evident connection with them
. is that it was written in the same scriptorium. If this be the true explanation,
then OA’s marginal passages have in all probability resulted from a comparison
of its text with that of some other manuscript, or manuscripts, in the
scriptorium. For there is one point on which we may be sure—that the main
text of OA and its marginalia never came from the same immediate source.
This is additional proof that the exemplar of the present complete ΟΑ was not
the original De Legitur. Not onlyis it incredible that with the author's own
copy available as a model a part of OA should have been copied from a third

or fourth rate manuscript, but the theory of a single early derived source for
the Digby manuscript is forever shattered when we find that the scribes who
wrote the marginal passages copied on the side and bottom of the pages not
only such afflatam as corne from Bracton himself, but also matter which can
never be accredited to him. Everything points to a comparison-and a very
extended comparison at that-having been made with one or more other texts
