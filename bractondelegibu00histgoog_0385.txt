PEDIGBEE OF THE MANUSCBIPTS

The facts which have been brought together in the preceding paragraph
have an added weight because of their number. By no means all the variants
in the collated passages which would help to support the suggestion that (Ι)
had sprung from some not fully revised draft of the Dc Legibus have been
pointed out. From timeto time the other groups make omissions similar to
those we have just been considering. But omissions of this sort outside of (Ι)
are exceptional, and that group alone makes a consistent claim for priority of
descent. (ΙΙ), for instance, omits the first case referred to on f. 413 for
which (Ι) gives the wrong judge and year. But this is notan omission
comparable to those typical of (Ι), as will be seen when the subject of
addiciooes is discussed. A few lines farther on (f. 413, l. 23), the omission of
“et alia placita” by (ΙΙ) represents yet another type of omission. As further
contrasting the usual insertion or omission of (ΙΙ) with a typical variant in (1)
we may take some other readings on this same f. 413. In l. 28 the reading of
(ΙΙ) is “ubi impetrari non deberet”; in l. 81 (ΙΙ) omits the enclosed et-
“violentia et armis, (et) impetraverit breve’'; in l. 82 (Ι) omits the breve in
“valere non debet breve.” Of these variants the stoa is clearly wrong, the
omission of et is an out and out omission of a necessary word, but the breve,
either absent or present, does not alter the sense of the passage. There are
poor and incorrect readings in (Ι) just as there are corruptions in (ΙΙ) and
(ΙΙΙ); out and out errors occur in all the lines. But these are usually more
or less easily explainable. What can not be satisfactorily explained, except
on the theory of a double-headed origin, are these peculiar variants in (Ι)
which are found in such large numbers in all parts of the text.

We may therefore regard the nucleus of (Ι) as embodying a tradition
which is certainly very old, and in all likelihood older than the texts of (ΙΙ) or
(ΙΙΙ). The manuscripts which best represent this tradition are OB, MA, ΜΒ,
ΜΝ, LF, LG, MD. Three of these, OB, LF, LG, are practically the same,
with either OB or LG better than LF, which omits large sections of text. The
scribe of LG ma‘y possibly have been slightly more trustworthy than he who
copied OB. But there is little difference between the two manuscripts, and

OB is far more accessible. MA and MD have both been influenced by

> corrections from outside, MA showing more of the typical readings of (Ι).

ΜΒ has a relatively large number of variants peculiar to itself alone, but
follows in the main the line of (Ι). The traditional readings of (Ι) may besecured
by a comparison of OB, MA, ΜΒ, as any variant upon which they all agree
may be regarded as giving us the reading of their common ancestor. In case
