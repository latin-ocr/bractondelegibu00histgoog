THE ADDICIONES

whose right to a place in the text might for any reason be disputed. Two
good types of these passages will be found on f. 15 and ftssssb. There are
also in the manuscripts and notin V a number of passages, some of them long
ones, which have all the characteristics of additiones and were clearly not in the
text as first written. As they likewise will be given, and their probable
authorship discussed, in the list of additiones, there is no need of further
considering them here. Typical passages of this sort which may be referred
to will be found in that portion of the text which in V is given on fs. 28, alob,
aaa, aaa, arob. Ν

Another matter which requires attention in passing is the subject of the
rubrics. In the first place, not once or twice, but time aster time, whole
sentences in the printed book turn out to be nothing but rubrics which have
become incorporated into the text. This fact becomes so apparent the
moment the list of addidoaes is looked over that specific illustratione of it need
not be given here. In the second place, many of the longer rubrics in V are
αᾱώὶηῗοπεε. Some of these are usually found in the manuscripts and some are
not. In the third place, rubrics in V are sometimes so different from those
found in the manuscripts that they must be changed for others. Not infre·
quently the rubrics in V are of excessive length as compared with those
usually given by the manuscripts. Compare, for instance, the rubric to sect. 5,
fi899b,—so long that it practically amounts to a restatement of the whole
first half of the section-with the brief rubric found in the manuscripts, De
receptionibus ia omni placito.

Inasmuch as the thorough collation with many manuscripts to which the
text of V must be subjected may be counted upon to straighten out this
matter of the rubrics, the discussion of this subject could end here were it not
for the fact that so many of the manuscripts are affected in the same marmer
as V in this respect that a general discussion of the subject of rubrics must
necessarily precede the use of the rubrics in the manuscripts to correct those of
V. The incorporation of so many rubrica in the text of the manuscripts and
their being sometimes marked as addieioaea, leads us to believe that in the
original copy of Bracton the rubrics were written in the margin in black ink,
as were the addicimus. And this is what we should naturally expect. The
first draft of the De Legibus could hardly have been as mechanically finished
a piece of work as many of the later copies. Ordinarily the rubrics in the
extant manuscripts are written in red inlr in the indented spaces which have
been left for them. Sometimes they are written in the body of the text, in
