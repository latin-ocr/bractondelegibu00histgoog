sanctos: DE LEGIBUS

ancestor of that group had been supplied for this portion of the treatise with
marginal audiam which later became incorporated in the text of its
descendants. No other explanation fits into all the circumstances of the case.

The first suggestionis not as fantastical as it may at first appear, in spite
of the fact that it is not possible to hit upon any reasonable motive why Bracton
' should have first worked over a part of his text not limited or bounded by any
of the natural divisions of the treatise. To begin with, the addicientes in this
particular portion of the treatise for which (Ι) is willing to stand sponsor are
supported by the manuscripts in general, including with hardly any exceptions
OD, MC, ΟΕ, Y. Take the passage on f. 45. It is altogether probable that
the manuscripts here follow in their main text the same lines of descent as
were shown by the collation to apply to the passage on fs, 88-85. On this
basis the seventeen manuscripts compared for the additio on tta represent
four subgroups in (1), four subgroups in (ΙΙΙ), and all the available manu·
scripts in (ΙΙΙ). Out of these OA and LA are the only ones which omit
from the main text, and the latter is marginal. This passage is therefore very
generally supported by (1), (ΙΙ), and (ΙΙΙ). For the additio on f. 46b there
have been examined nineteen manuscripts which fully represent the principal
subgroups of (Ι), (ΙΙ), and (ΙΙΙ). Again OA and LA are the only manuscripts
which omit in the main text, LA as before being marginal. For f. 47 sixteen
manuscripts representing the usual subgmups have been compared. OA and
LA alone omit. The same statements apply to the passage on f. 49 for which
eighteen broadly representative manuscripts have been compared. Even more
striking is the result of the comparison of the addrcio on Ι. 52. Out of thirty-
nine manuscripts, all but four have the passage either at the end of section one
or following section two. One manuscript has in both places. Two mark it as
additional. Of the four which do not give it, ML and LF are semi-abbrevi-
ated texts, frequently omitting passages of very considerable length which are
unquestionably parts of the text proper. This again places ΟΑ and LA by
themselves. 0u't of thirty-seven typical manuscripta, representing all groups
and sub-groups, they alone omit. In general, the same conditions are met
with in the other additional passages within the limits of fs. 45-151. Now
and then another manuscript or two will be found to omit the passage with OA
and LA, but for the most part these two texts stand alone in this respect. lt
is possible, too, that in some casea as notably in that of OC for fs. arb-aab,
the manuscripts tabulated as omitting may in reality have the passage in
some part of the text so far removed from the regular place asto have
