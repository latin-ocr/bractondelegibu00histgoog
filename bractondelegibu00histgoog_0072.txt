BaAtrmN: DE LEGIBUS

unconseiously emphasizes the fact in the expressions he uses in starting out
ou the new topic. Many of his “dietum est supra. . . . nunc autem
dicendum est'’ beginnings show very clearly this transition. A careful study
of this osten recurring phrase in its many settings would probably reveu]
something of the speed with which Bracton worked, or at least would show
some of the points at which he took up his work again aster periods of
inactivity. From the standpoint of the present discussion, however, the
important thing is to find out, if possible, how his scheme actually worked out;
to reconstruct, as far as the evidence will permit, the outline on which the text
was developed. Now this is not quite the same thing as making an analysis
of the text of the treatise. Such an analysis, if it were at all detailed, would
produce an outline so involved as to make it unthinlrable that the author had
ever worked according to it. In a work of such magnitude, the composition
of which must have been spread over many years, it was inevitable that
digressions should occur, that something originally intended should be omitted
und that something not planned for should be added, For this reason the
mere dividiug of the work in its present form into a bewilderiug series of
topics and sub-topies will not give us what we wish. We need to discover
the simpler scheme, the workable outline on which Bracton developed his
book. By letting the text tell its story this is possible. Bmcton starts on the
basis of the old threefold division of Persons, Things, Actions.¹ Persons is
treated very briefly on fs. 4b-7b.’ Things is subdivided into two main
divisions, De rerum clivi-simae, and De adquirendo rerum αἰοτιιὶηἰο, occupying
respectively fs. 7b-8b‚· ab-osb! The second of these divisions is again divided
into two principal divisions‚ ex iure naturali‚⁵ and ecc iure civili,- this latter
being further subdivided into many heads. There can be no question but that
in Bracton's mind De adquirendo rerwm dominio was the main subject for that
large portion of his treatise so entitled in the printed text. The words et the
