BRACI'ON: DE LEGIBUS

last of the passages collated, OA and CC agree together against all others some
forty·odd times, in addition to being found together more than twice that
number of times in variants affecting their larger groups. Now this is all within
the space of two and one-half folios of the printed text; it suggests strongly
that the texts are too closely related to be other than parent and child. When
OA reads brevi respondere where CC and the other manuscripts read breui
ogere, cum mom teneatur olim sime brem respondere, it is proof positive that CC
could not have been copied from OA, though there is no reason why the latter
might not have been copied from CC. When CC reads Item absque errore
apparere, similarly to most of the other manuscripts, and OA has only Item
apparere, there is yet the possibility, though not to so great an extent, that
CC may have been the exemplar of OA in this part of its text. But when
OA, agreeing with the reading accepted by the other texts, has Item cadit
breve si, and de Richordo filio Godefi‘idi, and huiumnodi et cum brevi, and prius
egerit cum, and ogere inceperit, where CC reads Item cadit si,-de Richardo
marafim-tuimur· cam brevi-prims cam-ogere, it is definitely settled
that CC was not the parent of OA. We should be slow to say that in closely
related pairs such as OC, ΟΕ, and CF, LT, one was copied from the other,
even though no omissions which may constitute a check are found in the
passages collated. These passages are short3 two manuscripts copied froma

third may go on for a considerable distance without any such ebech, which
might, perhaps, be found in a section immediately preceding or following the
passage collated.

For the reasons which have already been noticed, it is inevitable that the
collation should be full of contradictions of agreement. In many cases one’s
first thought is that some manuscript has been read wrongly. But the
contradictions do not disappear with a second reading, even the most glaring
of them remain after the ground has been gone over several times, and
particular attention paid to them. Itis not necessary to give examples as
they are perfectly apparent. In one way or another the situation is exceed·
ingly mixed up. All that can be done is to take each collated part separately,
draw as definite conclusions as possible from that particular passage, and from
the evidence furnished by the different porticus evolve some general scheme
of relationship. The data is not sufficient to make possible the working out
of a detailed pedigree of every portion of every manuscript. In view of the
many copies which have been lost and the consequent lack of intermediate
family lines, it is doubtful if even a complete collation would do that. But
