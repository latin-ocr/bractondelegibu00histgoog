PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

weight because of their numerous disagreements. Assar as ean be judged
from the rather meager data furnished by the collation of this passage, the
position of the manuscripts in group (ΙΙ) should remain practically the same as
for fs. 161-162b. =

This leaves OA, OD, MC, ML, LA, PH, OG, MF, Ρ, Υ, for group
(ΙΙΙ). The first seven of these are clearly in one large group‚ and while their
exact positions are not readily discemible, there is no reason for not aceepting
the arrangement made for these same manuscripts on the basis of the collation
some eighteen folios earlier. Both OC and OG show a tendency to agree
more or less frequently with (ΙΙΙ), but there is nothing to indicate that a
relationship exista between the two. The agreement of OG and CE—omission
of querens posuerat in msa sao-mlls to mind the fairly constant agreement of
OG, ΟΕ, OC, on fs. lla-llob. But it is only in its first part that OG agrees
noticeably with OC or OC, ΟΕ. This passage is in that later second part,
added after the abbreviated first part had not been found satisfactory, in
which OG for fa. 161-162b showed a decided preference for the same tradition
as that followed by Y. The natural conclusion is that OC follows the readings
of (ΙΙΙ) at times because it is on what may be called the border line between
(ΙΙ) and (ΙΙΙ), and that the second part of OG continues in the same line as
at the beginning of the Assise of Novel Disseisin. ΜΕ and P forma pair
group‚ the exact position of which is not clear. They have the determinative

dictorum for dicti of (ΙΙ), follow in general the tradition of (ΙΙΙ), and in the

position which they give to the addicto agree with ΜΟ and LA against all
others, If it were not for their use of dictorum there would be no hesitation
in assigning thern the same place as for fs. 161-162b, which is found only
ten folios earlier in MF and even less distant, seven folios, in P. These two
texts certainly follow (ΙΙΙ) rather than (ΙΙ), and in view of the fact that
dictorum may very easily have come from a correction in some common
ancestm, it will be well to allow them to retain their position in (ΙΙΙ).

Such additional evidence as the additio fumishes is largely of a supple-

mentary nature. As already noticed‚ in the matter of the position of the

addicto, MF and P agree with MC and LA. This is in line with the general
connection of MC, LA, Y, P, ΜΕ, for fs. lla-loab, which has been discussed
above. What stands out most distinctively is the combination of ME, MH,
CF, LT, CA, X, LD. They agree against all others as to the place which the
additio should occupy, and have the longer Item videre dabam iuratores for the
usual Quia. In addition ME, MH, CF, LT, have in for de. The connection
