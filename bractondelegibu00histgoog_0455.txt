THE ADDICIONES

hardly be accepted as Bracton’s-fonnd generally in the manuscripts of group
(II), but repudiated by those in (1) and (ΙΙΙ).

F. aab, l. 28. Et simfliter animo. . . prasenti. Regular in MD, CM,
and some manuscripts in (II). Marginal in ME. Omitted in OA, OB, MA,
ΜΒ, ΜΟ, MN, CC, ΟΕ, LA, Y. This addition savors of Bracton in both
form and fitness, bnt the manuscripts do not give us sufficient authority to
allow ns to attribute it to him.

F. 29, ΙΙ. 07-40. 0000000000 lacten. . . . apcius Godsm'di. Regular in
OD, OF, MG, ΜΗ, ΟΜ, Β (marks additional). Inserted aster debeam, l. 42,
LA, MC (marks plua); aster debeat, l. 43, LD. Marginal in ME. Omitted
iu OA, OB, OC, OE, MA, ΜΒ, MD, MN, CE, Y. References of this kind
to bad judgments are found more than once in the De Legibus. See, for
instance, Casus frte evehit apud Cloaihdoaw . . . . et male fait ibi terminatam on
f. 45, and Male 000000 est in contrarium on f. aab. These two passages, which
are additional, are so generally found in the manuscripts as to practically
establish their right to a place in the treatise. This addicto on Ι. 29 is not so
well supported by the manuscripts, but the evidence rather favors Bracton as
the author. For documenta bearing on Godfrey of Crewecombe and Robert
of Muscegros, see Twiss’s edition, II, xxii, 609, 610.

Fs. 2900011. 42-0. Item 000 pater. . . . heredibus suis. Regular in
MG, ‚MH, CM. Inserted aster habuit, l. 16, f. 00, MD, OC (marks addi· ,
tional); after planam est, l. 0, Ι. 00, ΟΕ (marks additional); after capitata,
l. 0, Ι. 00, ΜΟ (marks plus). Marginal in ME. Omitted in OA, OB, OD,
MA, ΜΒ, ΜΝ, ΟΟ, ΟΕ, LA, Y. The evidence of the manuscripts against it
puts this additio in the doubtful list.

F. 02, ΙΙ. 5-01. Vel quod id. . . . 0000 domno 0001000. Regular in OC
(marks additional), OF (marks additional), MG (marks additional), ΜΗ
(marks additional), MD, CM (marks additional). Marginal in ΜΕ. Inserted
after probotIoab, l. 1, OD3 aster 000οΜοἤ000, Ι. 06, ΜΟ (marks plus).
Omitted in OA, OB, MA, MB, MN, ΟΕ, ΟΟ, LA, Y. This passage has so
many of the earmarks of an addicto from Bracton that if form and content
were the grounds on which the authorship οΙ an addicio was to be decided it
would naturally be attributed to the writer of the treatise. On the other
hand, the authority of the manuscripts which challenge its authenticity is so
considerable asto make its actual standing a matter of doubt.

Fs. sabaa, 11. ar-ao. Item qui proprietatem . . . . 0000 erit. Regulo
in MD, OF, OC (marks additional), OD, OM, MF, MG, MH, ΜΙ, MK,
