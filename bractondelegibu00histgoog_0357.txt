PEDIGBEE OF THE MANUSCBIPTS

For (ΙΙΙ) may be taken as a standard (OA, OD, Mc, CB, LA, PH).
For by ¹far the greater portion of the text, if we may judge from the scattered
pieces of collation, this group very rigidly maintains its identity; but it breaks
down in the last two passages.

If any other manuscript is to be added to the six chosen to represent (ΙΙΙ)
that manuscript is ML, which follows more than one tradition, but keeps
closer to that of (ΙΙΙ) than to any other. It will be noticed that PH is not
collated for any one of the three longer passages, nor for the last short one. In
every place for which they are compared, with the exception of the passage on
alab, which is not fully determinative, OD and PH show a rather close
relationship. The question is whether PH follows OD and goes over to (Ι) in
the latter part of its text. On f. alab it both agrees and disugrees with OD.
For the beginnings of the two writs collated on f. 419, PH agrees most often
with ΜΡ. As MF and OD form a pair group for fs.413-415b it is to be
inferred that there is a connection between OD and PH in this part of the
text. For the passage on f. 410, where reference is made to the Digest, a
number of manuscripts have been collated. In the few lines which have been
compared PH manifests a decided tendency to go with the representatives of
(Ι) rather than with those of any other group, as the following variants will
show: quau, OB, MA, ΜΒ, PH, Y, qui si, OA, OC, CC, CM, LA, P;
iusticia poterit, OB, MA, ΜΒ, ΡΗ, iusticia, OA, OC, CM, LA, P, Y, CC;
catilin, OB, MA, ΜΒ, ΡΗ, CM, P, auailio potest (poterit), OA, OC, CC,
LA, Y; falsis, OA, OC, CC, CM, LA, P, similibus, OB, MA, MB, PH, Y;
iadicem, OB, MA, MB, PH, mulier vero (ooo) iudicent, OA, OC, CC, CM,
LA, Y. '

Much more difficult than the determination of the places which should be

occupied hythe manuscripts constituting groups (Ι), (ΙΙ), (ΙΙΙ), is the assign-

279 .
