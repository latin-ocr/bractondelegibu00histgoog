PEDlGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

death had taken the assises. The inference is clear. If the annotator of HA
had lived a generation earlier, in the same or some other part of Devonshire‚ it
would have been almost impossible for him to have made a similar set of
marginal references to cases from his own locality without touching upon
something which in some way or other would be connected with Bracton, so
intimately for almost a quarter of a century had the great judge been
associated with the judicial life of that county. We know that other men,
practically from the beginning, referred in the margins of their copies of
Bracton’s book to cases in which they had, for one reason or another, amore
than usual interest. We know that Bracton himself might have done so, but
not that he actually did. We should therefore argue on the possibility, not
on the probability, of his having been the author of the earlier case annotations.

But we are getting too far away from the point in hand. For the present,
at least, the fact of importance, which should be remembered, is that whether
Bracton himself or some one else is responsible for the Canas marginalia, OA
is not at all unique in having them, nor is that codex raised to a position of
special prominence because of them. What makes OA agood manuscript is
not its quire arrangement or its case annotatione, but the fact that it is preemi-
nent in the matter of designating the additiones, and that it has, for the most
part, a good text.

Having ascertained that the peculiar features of OA do not in any way
tend to mark it off as a primary copy of the original, we may revert to the
subject which necessitated this discussion of the Digby manuscript, and
consider again the meaning of the unusual order of certain blocks of text in
some of the codices. Now that the facts as to the structure of OA have been
given it is evident that these variations in the other copies are connected, in
some way or other, with the quire scheme of hand IV in OA.1 That hand
wrote quires F, G, P, R, S, T; F and G contain the text of fs. aab-983 R
begins the “praemortuorum” passage; S is the quire in which the omitted

Action for Dower should come regularly. One point about which we can be
