PEDIGREE OF THE MANUscmPrs

say with the OF nucleus of gmup (Ι Ι), which have the additio and tradiderit.
Added value is given to the verb variant in this case because the original
reading of group (I) is plainly tradiderat. (Ι) also omits the additio. Except
for such light nsit throws upon this special point of relationship the additio
may be passed over for the present.

Fomo 411b

The principal value of this collation, coming as it does only two folios
before the longest of the collated passages is that it shows the value and
position of OE. That manuscript is found in (Ι), in the sub-group (OB, OD,
OE, ΜΒ, ΜΙ, ΜΝ, LF, LG), and in the pair group (OE, ΜΙ). In other
respects and for the other manuscripts, which are the same in both passages
the situation is exactly that of fs. lla-415b.

Each of the diagrams given above has been drawn on the basis of the
evidence in the particular passage to which it applies. These diagrams differ
because many of the manuscripts follow different traditions in different parts
of their texts or, if they remain in the same large combination, change their
positions within the group itself. In many respects they are far from
satisfactory. Yet they give a very good idea of how mixed up the relationship
of the manuscripts really is. lt will be noticed, however, that while some of
the manuscripts change their traditions so frequently that no one graph is able
to illustrate the relationship of all the different portions of each text, many of
them are more or less constant in their adherence to a single line. In each of
the three principal groupS, (1), (ΙΙ), (ΙΙΙ), there are a number of codices which
show up in the same position for at least the great majority of places in which
they have been collated. To these manuscripts a fairly definite place in the
family trec may be assigned, while to most of the others an approximate
position can be given. On this basis, by using the combined information in
all the collated passages, it is possible to draw a figure which will give a more
comprehensive idea of the general relationship.

Taking the larger groups for all places collated, (I)-using (OB, MA, ΜΒ,
ΜΙ), MI, ΜΝ, LC, LF, ΕΟ, ΟΕ), as astandard-is made up of the following:
Fs. 33b85-( ), -ΜΙ, LC; †ME‚ CC, P, MF, Y, CF, LT. ΟΕ is lacking.
Fs. 161-162b-( ), †OM‚ HA, W, CM. OE, MN, lacking.

Fs. lla-415b-()‚ -LC; ÷0D‚ MF, Y, HA, (and probably PH). ΟΕ,
lacking.
