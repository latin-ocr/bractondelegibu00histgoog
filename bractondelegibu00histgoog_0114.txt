BRACI'ON: DE LEGIBUS

margin. Some of them are also found in the text. It is perfectly clear that
alter CB had been written it was compared with another copy, the one making
the comparison copying into the margin of CB such fflnhocr in the other
book as CB did not have at the same place as this copy. The fact that CB
might have the same uddicio at another place apparently made no difference
with this process of comparison and copying. On the other hand, we can not
be sure that all the manuscripts which have no marginalia of this nature were
copied from models which likewise had no additions in their margins. Some
of the copyists omitted agreat deal, as we have noticedÍ¾ in how many instances,
for one reason or another, the marginalia of a manuscript failed to pass over to
its progeny we can not tell. In MA the scribe has several times written in
the margins of his hook, opposite the places where the additional passages
should come, the single word addicio. This would seem to indicate that either
he or the scribe of his exemplar was aware of the existence of addictam which
neither of them copied. This does not necessarily mean that there were
passages in the margins of some ancestor of MA at these particular points,
but it does show that there might be no insertion of the addicio even when the
writer or reader of a particular manuscript was fully aware of the existence of
such an addition.

From the foregoing it is evident that there is nothing in the addicares
which will offer us an easy way of determining the pedigree of the manuscripts,
In general it may be said that any evidence of family relationship fumished by
the adamam is principally of value in supplementing that derived from the
main text, hy collations and otherwise. Of and by itself it is of little value. ,

THE PASSAGES CHOSEN Fon COLLATION

In addition to the larger and more widespread differences of division into
parts, order of subjects, and treatment of the additional matter, there are other
variations of a minor character, especially those which are peculiar and
individual to a particular manuscript. These help us to form rather an esti-
mate of the worth of the manuscript, its relative goodness or badness as
compared with the other copies than any definite idea as to its place in the
family tree. In other words, there are none of the extemal or more special
features of the early written texts which will give us anything more than a hazy
notion as to how they are related to one another. Such trifies of information .
