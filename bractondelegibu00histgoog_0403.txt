THE ADDICIONES

contains the text to be found on fs. atabatab of V, OA has two additiones,
Sed cum plures associant. . . . ignoraret, aliud esset, and, Ut aanor quoe sint

. . . . et occ inter tales. Neither of these is to be found in the other
manuscripts thus far examined, nor are they in V. The second type represents
passages marginal in OA but given regularly in the other manuscripts. Thus
the last eighteen lines ou f. 195, Si autem contra . . . . sed contra, which in
OA are marginal, are given regularly in OB, OC, OD, OF, MA, ΜΒ, MC,
ME, CE, CM, LA. The last lines of sect. 2, f. 238, Per boc autem. . . . non
aspellat, are marginal in OA but regular in the other manuscripts examined,
OC, OD, OF, OG, MA, ΜΒ, MC, ME, MN, CE, CM. In the third class
are passages which in OA are marginal, in the majority of manuscripts are
regular, and in some few other manuscripts are either marginal or omitted. ’
The passage on f. 180, ll. 17-19, already considered on p. 828 above, is of this
type. F. 150, ll. 81-82, qaia (qai) convincitur . . . . facere proposuit, is
marginal in OA and Y,is omitted in LA, and is regular in OB, OC, OD, OF,
MA, ΜΒ, MC, MD, ME, CE. Here it is quite clear that OA, LA, Y, show
their irregularities because one or more of the scribes mistoolr the quio qui in
one line lor the same words in the next line (in the manuscripts the quio of V
inl. 82 reads quinqua).

This shows that the marginal passages in OA may bc not only addicioaes
generally accepted by the manuscripts as such, but also extraneous matter
which the majority of the manuscripts in all lines refuse to recognize as either
addit-im or text. Among them also are passages which the other manuscripts
regard as portions of the text proper. And yet other of the marginal entries in
OA are there because the similarity of words in adjoining sentences caused one
scribe to lose his place and omit what another scribe brought back by inserting
in the margin as a correction. In other words, OA may by no means be
thought osas preserving in its margin only such additional passages as come
from Bracton. The value ofa marginal entry in OA, or its authorship, can be
determined only by such evidence as the manuscripts in general fumish. And
this is true of the marginalia in any of the other manuscript copies of the De
Legibus. In the margins of any of them which have any appreciable amount
of writing outside the hmits of the main text will usually be found additiones
from Bracton, addiciones from sources other than Bracton, and passages which
are not addiderim at all. But these facts are particularly interesting and
important because of the light they throw upon the circumstances which
brought so many passages into the margins of OA. They make it evident
