BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

going to write a Summo, he says. The use of Samma here is natural enough3
it was a word commonly employed to designate such a work as his. He was
using Azo’s two Sumam at a little later time Hengham was to write his
Samma Magna and Summa Parva, and Thomton his Summa based on the De
Legibus. More than one of the numerous little legal tracts which sprang into
being in the generation after Bracton was to be called a Samma. It was in
the regular course of things that he should call his treatise a Summa rather than
a Liber. This Summo was to be written “sub ordine titulorum et paragraph·
orum sine praeiudicio melioris sententiae.’' These are important words in
considering the question as to whether or not Bracton meant to have his
Summa divided into books. They present two problems-what is the naalma
scatentia to which heresem, and just what meaning does he intend to have
titulorum conveyl It is necessary to discover not what the words might mean,
but exactly the sense in which the author used them. As to titulus, does he
wish to give it a broad or a narrow meaning? Shall De Perennis be one
“title‚” or shall such a subject be divided into many titles, as De Ingaunis,
De Libertiais, etc? Is it to be De Rebus, or twenty titles more or less in
place of one general title on Thingsl Or will he follow Azo's rubric and make
two titles on this subject, De Rerum Divisioae and De naam Adquivitioae?
At the beginning of chapter VI on f. ab there is a passage which may throw
some light on this question.

“Dictum est supra de iure naturali, gentium et civili, sed quia omne ius
de quo tractare proponimus pertinet vel ad personas, vel ad res, vel ad actiones
secundum leges et consuetudines Anglicanas, et curn dignitores sint personae,
quarum causa statuta sunt omnia iura, ideo de personis primo videamus ..... ”

Bracton has taken these words directly from Azo‚ but in the positive
belief that they applied to English law as well as to Roman, as his “according
to the English laws and customs” shows. It would appear, therefore, that at
this point, after having given a number of fundamental Roman definitions‚ he
had adopted from Azo and the Institutes three leading topica PersonS,
Things, Aetiona The dc iare natarali, gentiam et civili is a title in both Azo

and the Institutes 'If “Dictum est supra de iure‚” ete, meant to Bracton ¹

“Dictum est supra dc titolo de iure,” etc, then his “de personis'’ would
naturally be equivalent in his mind to Azo’s title “De iure personarum‚” and
he would seem to be actually employing the titles in the Institutes for his
titles. Moreover, his choice of material from this earlier law is made according
to the written tides, some of which he has taken and some of which he has
