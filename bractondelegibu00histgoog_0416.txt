BRACI'ON: Dll LEGIBUS

its quires which have no marginalia, a very large proportion of all the
addicares found in all the other manuscripts combined are given in its
margins. Such comparison of the manuscripts in (ΙΙΙ) aa is necessary to
understand the way in which that group treats the addiciorws naturally rests
upon OA as a basis. Or it would perhaps be more correct to say that any
detailed consideration of the Digby manuscript in this particular necessarily
takes in the other members of the same group, especially ΟΕ and LA.

On first sight OA’s treatment of the addicimus, just as its quire scheme,
has a tendency to create the impression that it is following a model very close
to the original copy of the De Lagina. The general high average of
excellence of OA’s text, its comparative freedom from conuptions and altera·
tions, is sufficient proof that it comes from an immediate source far nearer
to the original than that represented by most of the extant manuscripts By
no means may it be regarded merely as a copy of one of the more ordinary
type of texts, with interpolations and additions removed to the margins.
What appears most extraordinary, perhaps, as the manuscript is studied‚ isthe
fact that many addicionea which have become incorporated in the text not
only of other manuscripts in (ΙΙΙ), but also in the manuscripts of group (Ι),
are either marginal or omitted in OA. On the face of it this seems to
contradict what has already been emphasized—that the nucleus of (I) repre

sents an older tradition than the more complete text as found in (ΙΙΙ),οΑ
included. If we were to go contrary to the evidence and assume that Bracton
had but one copy of his treatise on which to continuato work and to which to
make additions, wc should be forced to acknowledge that all the author’s

adamans must have stood in the margins of that single original. No other
place could have received them. For they were not mere alterations or

corrections which could have been ¹written within the lines, but actual
additions of such substantia] length, and so evidently due to later and more
mature consideration on some rereading, that it is impossible to think that any
provision for space which they should later occupy could have been made for
them in the text as first drafted, which went on smoothly and uninterruptedly
without them. This being admitted, it would be necessary to go farther and
admit that a manuscript which was very closely reproducing the author's
original copy would also have the addicimus in the margins. In other words,
that manuscript would present just such an appearance as ΟΑ in regard to its
marginalia. But how little in addition to the external appearance of its
marginal passages ΟΑ has which may give it any claim to be at all exactly
