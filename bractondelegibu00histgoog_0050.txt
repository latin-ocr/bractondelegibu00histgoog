BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

ΜΒ and LB are divided by quires. OM is divided into eight books, the
points of division being: cap. XII, f. 7b3 cap. XXIX, f. 62b; cap. Ι,
Ι. 98b; cap. I, f. 159b3 cap. Ι, Ι 296; cap. Ι, Ι. 317b3 cap. I, f. 8271).
CH is divided into seven books, of which the first ends on Ι aab of the
printed text and the second begins at sect. 3, raab. Book III begins
with cap. Ι, Ι. 98b; IV with the treatise Dc Corona (the second trcatise of
the third book in V); V with the Assise of Novel Disseisin3 VI with a passage
from f. 207b3 VII with the Writ of Right. OF and LE, as already noted,
are divided into ceateaae. In ML the kalendar divides the text into 380
sections'or chapters; similarly Mc is divided into sections as follows-bk. l,
254; ΙΙ, 826 (corr. to 322); ΙΙΙ, 448; IV, 3403 V, 244 -Ι- 4 οΙ extraneous
matter. Attention has already been called in the description of ΜΒ to the
fact that this manuscript is arranged in its index by sections and chapters.
Those manuscripts not mentioned here have been passed over because they
show no noticeable plan ofdivision. Ἰ

Taken altogether this evidence is far from satisfactory. Instead of
answering the old questions it raises new ones. It does not definitely tell us
into how many parts or at what points the De Legibus should be divided.
What it does show is that there is no one scheme of division which the manu·
scripts as a whole follow. So far as a given number of books is conccmed the
codices seem to choose five, though an apparent agreement in this particular is
weakened by their failure to decide upon the same points of division. The
point which stands out most prominently in these various schemas is the
beginning of the trcatise on the Writ of Right (f. 827b), marking the
commencement of book four in one set of codices, of book five in another, and
in individual copies of book three, seven, eight. Next in prominence is the
place at which the Assise of Novel Disseisin begins. Book three in one
group, book four in another group of manuscripts starts here, though it
should be noticed that the latter put the beginning of this subject two short
chapters in advance of the place where it starts in the other group. This same
inability on the part of these two sets of manuscripts to agree upon thc point at
which the treatment of a new subject begins-due probably to the ease with
which Bracton passes from one topic to another—is seen at another place,
namely‚ at what in V is the beginning of De recreationibus} OA, OB, OE,
etc, begin their fisth book at the second chapter of the last trcatise in the

printed text and its authorities. The first chapter is short-about a folio in
¹ r. asab.
