PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

Dower, has the same arrangement as ML at this place.¹ CF, always agreeing
closely with LT, does the same thing* CC ends its 1. 11111 with 0 passage
found in the middle 01 1. 261 01 V, followed by 2911003 01 vacant space3 1. 112
has the first column empty, and the next column begins with “premortuorum
ut videri‚” etc.⁸ In LA the end 01 Novel Disseisin on one folio is followed by
“praemortuorum ut videri‚” ete, beginning a new 10110 and a new hand.⁴ One
of the quires in OA begins with these same words.

As showing the amount 01 1011011οο from the usual order which may
occur, it is not out 01 placeto note that ML has many changes in addition to
those just given, the principal ones being: a passage on f. 292 01 V followed by
one on f. 821-(01 considerandum en't ll nisi per C qui non); similarly, f. 66 and
f. 78 (praemoriatur, per breve de recto, ll etcum de alio 100010);1.79 and
f. aab (quod semel ab initio. ll Cum autem quis 0 11010100 000); 1. 92 and 1. 95
(inde dotare posset ll ita quod eorum instrumentum: “quod eam inde dotare
poterit ll posset 110 interpretari instrumentum” 01 V); a passage on 1. 961113
followed by sect. 4, 1. 98, and this in turn is followed by the Action for
Dower; 13. 3041) 0011 abab run together (producta fuit secta. ll Et ideo de
brevi dotis); immediately alter sect. 8, 1. alab, comes sect. 6, 1. 442. There
are many other minor omissions and variations in ML, but those enumerated
here 010 sufficient to show that the manuscript is not one which could be used
as 0 model 101 either the correct order or a complete text. 10 CB there is to
be noticed another type of irregularity. The Action for Dower begins
regularly 00 1. 126 01 the codex. F. 128 ends with “defuncto patri quoad
successionem'’ on f. 299 01 V. F. 1281) begins the treatise 00 Entry, and the
text ends regularly on Ι1. 1861). 011 1 193--1110 intervening 101103 010
missing-a new hand begins with “propter ignorantiam utriusque parentum,’'
as 00 1. 299 01 V. The subject of Dower is finished 00 1. 2021) 01 the
manuscript, and 0110100 empty space of half a column, 1. 208 begins with
chapter twenty-nine 00 1. 621) 01 the printed book.

¹ 10 the margin is 0 0010 10 the effect that 1110110 leaves 010 missing here. This may 01000 either that
the exemplar 01 LTatthis place began 0 0011 00110 with “praemortuorum‚” or that from 0 compar-ison 111111
other MSS. the omitted part was estimated to llll a quire 01 1110110 leaves.

'A note in the margin, in 1110 same hand as 1110 text, reads, “hic deficit maxima pars tertii tractatus
libri quarti de 000100 1001110 antecessoris, videlicet 101010 011001οί010 usque hoc-de hoc quod dicit in dominico,
ete„

⁸ F. 112 10 001 the 11101, but the fourth, 1001010 quire.

⁴ Not the 1100100103 01 0 new quire. This new hand is 110011 hand, 01 which 111010 010110101100 going ,
through sect. 1, f. 169, 01 V. After almost 0 whole page 01 empty 00000 the earlier 00011 haud begins again
with 11001. 1, 1. 169, 0011 goes to 1110001101 000. Xlll, 1. 974. Α vacant space 01 nearly a 1111010 10110 follows,
