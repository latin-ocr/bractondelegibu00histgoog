THE ADDICIONES

l. 30, in OC and MD, which mark additional. Marginal in OA. Omitted in
OB, OE, OF, OG, MA, ΜΒ, Y. (ME and ΟΜ omit the sentence immedi-
ately before this in V.) This additio is sufficiently well vouched for ta make
it seem likely that it was written by Bracton.

F. 3731),11. 32-34. Sed eaate. . . . eodem. Inserted alter dividatur,
1. 38, in OD, MC, LA; aiter petant, l. 4, f. 374, in OC, OF, OG, ΟΕ.
Marginal in OA. Omitted in OB, OE, MA, ΜΒ, MD, ME, Y. Another
passage which may quite safely be assigned to Bracton.

F. 374,11. 37·41. Sed suat paidom . . . affecerint. Regular in OD.
Inserted aster eat vaura, l. 36, in OB, MA, ΜΒ, MD, MN, Y; aster incoa-
venans, l. 5, f. 3741), in MC, LA. Marginal in OA. Omitted in OC, ΟΕ,
ΜΕ, CM. Notice the reference to William of Yorlr. From Bracton.

F. 3741),11. 16-19. Sed revera . . . . heredes sai. Regular in (I), ΟΕ,
Y, LA, and manuscripts generally. Omitted in ΜΕ, ΟΜ, and others of the
same group. From Bracton, whether an addicto or not.

F. 375,11. 25-27. etatae... Wettensa. Regular in OD, MC, LA,
ME, ΟΜ. Inserted aster permanebit, l. 5, in 0G; atter Bredas, 120, in OC,
OF, ΟΕ, ΜΚ. Marginal in OA. Omitted in OB, ΟΕ, MA, ΜΒ, MD, Y.
The case is given in the Note Boole, not from Easter, but from Trinity‚ term,
No. 411. In the margin opposite its first paragraph is the note, Noa fit
amatia, ut defende, qaia aaa aaut heredes. This should be compared with that
sentence in the treatise aster which the additio is inserted by OC, OF, ΟΕ.
Inasmuch as this passage is supported by all the groups with the exception of
(1), it may safely be assigned to Bracton.

F. 3751), 11. 19-22. Et bae. . . . acquiritur. Regular in OB, OC, OD,
ΟΕ, OF, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΙ, ΜΝ, ΟΕ, Y. Inserted atter supradicti, l. 28, in
MC, LA. Marginal in OA. Omitted in ΜΕ, ΟΜ. An additio which is
certainly from Bracton.

F. 3751), 11. 31-35. Sed naturaliter. . . . corpore. Regular in OC, OD,
OF, OG, MC, MD, ME, ΟΕ, ΟΜ, LA. Margine] in OA. Omitted in
OB, OE, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΙ, ΜΝ, Υ. One of Bracton’s later additiones.

Inserted aster capradicti, l. 28, in MD (marks additional); atter descensu, l. 5,
f. 376, in MC, LA; aster cap. VI, f. 376, in OC (marks additional). Marginal
in OA. Omitted in OB, OE, OF, OG, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΙ, ΜΕ, Y. The omis·
sion of this passage by OF and ME makes its authorship somewhat doubtful,
but it was probably written by Bracton.
