 

THE ADDlClONES

to sect. 6. The case is not given in the Note Book. The passage is probably
one of Bracton’s additions.

F. 385, ll. 24-27. Sioutem uuus. . . . natusest. Regular in OF, OC,
OG, and ΟΕ, MD (which omit only terra heredes. Si autem unas). Mar-
ginal in OA, LA, ΟΕ. Omitted in OB, OD, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΟ, ΜΙ, LC, Y
(omits qaod emoleret . . . . mutos est), ΜΕ (omits cum autem uuus. . . . uastos
est). This passage is of doubtful origin.

F. 386, ll. 20-23. Si post . . . . irrotulatio. Regular in OD. Used asa
rubrio in OA, OB, OC, ΟΕ, ΜΒ, ΜΟ, ΜΙ, MK, LA, ΟΕ, and manuscripts
generally.

F. 386b, ll. 11-17. St carnem vel . . .. noo sibiipsis. Regular in
MC, LC, LD, ΕΤ. Marginal in LA. Omitted in OA, OB, OC, OD, ΟΕ,
OF, OG, MA, ΜΒ, MD, ΜΕ, ΜΚ, ΟΕ, Υ, and manuscripts generally.
Not from Bracton.

F. 3901), ll. 6-10. Si autem . . .. esse heredem. Regular in OC, OF,
ΟΕ. Inserted after sect. 9, iu MC; after cuiuslibet, l. 4, in LC; after vel sic,
l. 4, in ΟΜ. Marginal in OA, LA. Omitted in OB, OD, ΟΕ, MA, ΜΒ,
MD, ΜΙ, Y. Doubtful.

F. 407, ll. 23-24. Nota quod . . . . eleemosina. Omitted in the manu-
scripts generally. Obviously not from Braeton.

F. 4091), 11. l-aa. Regulariter oerum est. . . . ab initio. Begular in
OC, MC, MD, ΜΕ, ΟΕ, LC. Marginal in LA. Omitted in OA, OB, OD,
ΟΕ, OF, MA, ΜΒ, ΟΟ, Υ. Case 11 in the Note Book may be an earlier
stage of this ease (see ΙΙ, 11, n. 4). The manuscripts do not vouch for this
passage in a way which makes one positive as to its origin. It should be kept
on the doubtful list until the collation of manuscripts representative of different
lines has revealed more of its history.

F. 411, 11. 1-25. m debiliter creditor . . .. ratione dilecti. Regular in
MC, LC. Marginal in LA, OC. Omitted in OA, OB, OD, ΟΕ, OG, MA,
MB, MD, ΜΕ, ΜΗ, ΟΟ, ΟΕ, Y. Et sirniliter . . . . vetitum (ll. 1-2) is

treated as a separate passage by ΜΕ, ΜΗ, LA, OC. With such an array of
manuscripts omitting this additio we are forced to regard Braeton’s authorship
of it as extremely doubtful. This is yet another additio of such length that
the collation of the manuscripts may reasonably be expected to throw some
. further light on its origin.

F. 4121), ll. 10-15. Sed revera locum. . . . nenses omnes. Inserted aster
quosdam, l. 1, f. 4121), in LC, MH, ΜΕ; after testamnto, l. 3, in ΟΟ, ΜΟ,
