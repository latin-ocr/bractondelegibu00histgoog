F. 68, ll. 84-87. Sed rc vcra. . . expauere. Regular in OB, OF,
OE, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΟ, MD, ME, MN, ΟΕ, ΟΜ, Υ. OmittedinOC. Marginal
in LA, OA. Another additio which gives every indication 01 having come
from Bracton. It is quite possible that many of these short asterthoughts
which in the manuscripts arc found so regularly at the end 01 titles or para-
graphs may never have stood in the margin.

F. 76b, ll. 14-18. Si autem acu sit . . . . capitalibus uwsuugiia Regular
in OC, MC. Inserted aster quartam bestiam, l. 48, in OB, MA, ΜΒ, MD,
ME, ΜΙ, MN, ΟΕ, ΟΜ, Υ. Marginal in OA, LA. On the evidence 01 ,
the manuscripts this must be assigned to Bracton.

F.79b.ll.1e1a Prout intimius . . . .per statutum. Omitted by OA,
OB, OC, OD, OE, OF, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΟ, MD, ΟΕ, ΟΜ, LA, and by mann-
scripts generally. Obviously not from Bracton.

Fa. vassall. 41-18. Εἰ iuste propter. . . . et huiusmodi. Regular in
OA, OB, MA, ΜΒ, MD, ME, ΟΟ, ΟΕ, ΟΜ, Υ. Inserted atter Gulfn'do,
l. 16, 1. 881), in ΜΟ. Marginal in LA. There need be no hesitation in
ascribing this to Bracton.

F. 881), ll. 85-89. Et quidsi. . . . amramitas capitalibus. Regular in
MC, OD. Inserted aster feodo, etc, 1. 4, 1. 88, in ΟΟ; atter terragium,
l. 48, 1. 881), 1)) ΟΒ, MA, ΜΒ, MD, ME, MN, OF, OE, ΟΕ, ΟΜ, Υ.

Marginal in OA, LA. From Bracton, 11 the manuscripts are to be believed.
F. 881), 11. 88-87. Et poterit tenens. . . . procedendum cst. Regular in

OD. Inserted aster dc sauna, 1. 48, 1)) OB, ΟΕ, OF, MA, ΜΒ, MD,
ME, Ml, MN, ΟΕ, ΟΜ, Υ. Marginal in OA. Omitted in OC, ΜΟ, LA.
Presumably from Bracton.

MA, ΜΒ, ΜΟ, MD, MN, ΟΕ, ΟΜ, Υ. Marginal in OA. Omitted in ΟΟ,
LA. This passage which is, in a measure, a repetition 01 what immediately
precedes itin V, should be assigned to Bracton on the authority 01 the different
groups and sub-groups which stand sponsor 10) 11.

F. 881), 11. 1688. Castu Hemici. . . . iu feoda Regular in OB, OE,
OF, OM, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΟ, MD, MH, MN, ΟΕ, ΟΜ, LC, Y. Marginal in
OA, OD. Omitted in OC, ML, LA. Inasmuch as this passage is supported
by (Ι), (ΙΙ), ΟΕ, Υ, and one member of (ΙΙΙ), 1)) the text proper, in addition
10 being found in the margin 01 two other manuscripts in (ΙΙΙ), 110 weight 01
evidence favors Bracton as the author. It is the citation of a case which has
to do with Bracton’s neighbors in Devonshire. See Note Boolc, I, 84, 168.
