PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

maleta (for onata) at this same place? Out of the thirty-five manuscripts
which contain this passage, twenty-nine, including the best, have amiatae for
a clearly needed mictu. We get the impression that Bracton, after having
correctly written personalia and realia in the same construction forgot the
breuia implied by the quodam and wrote onata, and that at different times
various correctors in individual manuscripts changed this word to the correct
mista. The fact should be emphasized that we can by no means take it for
granted that the manuscript which gives the best reading for any single
incorrect, ambiguous, or corrupt passage most nearly represents Bracton’s own
Ι Latin. He may have been, probably was, guilty at times of writing poor
Latin which would be corrected in the course of recopying. In the long run,
conformity‚ or lack of conformity‚ to the best text-reading will determine the
value of a particular manuscript. But in these instances of debatable variants
the best manuscripts rather than the best reading will probably most often
determine Bracton’s own language. Evcn this will not always hold; the
best texts are at times divided on the reading. Some of the best codices
have praetoriana for prator in the fourth line of f. 3. 'In this particular
instance it is evident that the trouble has come from an original prator aa.
(prator caim), the first dot of the caim abbreviation having been taken to
signify an abbreviated prata, which word was accordingly lengthened by
some of the copyists to proetoriraa to agree with the following ias. Though
these places at which it is aquestion as to which word should be used are
fairly frequent, the choice of any reading seldom alters the meaning. What
Bracton meant is often more easily discemed than just how he said it.

In connection with this subject of Bracton’s language it should be
pointed out that it is not possible to make much use of what on first thought
might suggest itself as a standard by which to judge the excellence of a
certain portion of the text—the fidelity with which the manuscripts follow the
words of Azo in those places where Bracton is quoting from the Italian
master. The editions of Azo differ among themselves; the manuscripts differ
even more. It is probable that Bracton’s manuscript copy of Azo was quite
different from any of the printed texts3 better perhaps, or worse. But the
possession of that copy would be necessary to make us at all sure, in detail, of
the reading of the Anonian passages which Bracton copied at times so
extensively. We can not expect these particular passages in the manuscripts
of the De Legibus to conform to the printed Azo in every respect, for the
simple reason that Bracton did not copy from any one of the printed editions.
