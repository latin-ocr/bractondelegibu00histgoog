BRACI'ON: DE LEGIBUS

terial as far as the point under discussion is concemed.

Not only might the table of contents be taken from a different source
than that of the rubrics in the text, but the latter might come from another
manuscript than the one which the scribe had used in copying the main text. In
a large number of instances the rubrics have been inserted in the spaces lest
for them by a hand different from that which wrote the text. Some of the
manuscripts have never had the rubric spaces filled in. This means, of course,
not only that the rubricator and the copyist were osten two different persons
(frequently, however, the scribe who wrote the text wrote the rubrics also),
but that the rubricating was not always done immediately aster the text had
been copied. That these differentes in person and time, and therefore possibly
also in place, led to the rubricator sometimes using another manuscript than
that from which the text had been copied, is more than probable on the face
of it Actual proof of this is found in Y. In this manuscript, at the bottom
of a page which corresponds to f. 92 ἱη V, the scribe who wrote the text
scrawled in lead the following rubrica, apparently from the exemplar which he
was using and as a guide to the rubricator: quid ait doaz· quid sit dos ration»
abilin quis possit dotem consumare,- quaudo et ubi et dc quara· quot sant
apecies dotis. And the rubricator filled in the spaces which the first scribe had
lest for the rubrics with: quid sit dar,- quid sit rationabilia dou· cui (no space had
been lelt for this); quaudo corastitueudo sit dua· ubi (no space had been left
for this); dotia apat (aio) quoe sunu dc quo re. The next four pagos of Y
are without any material of this sort for comparison‚ but on the fifth page the
copyist of the main text has lest scribbled in lead at the bottom: quod uuor
viduo remancre debeat in cop. orca per XL drbs post mortem 'viri donec doa
fuerit ci assignata, and item qualiter dosfuerit assignando. Above in their
proper places as before the rubricator has written, quod uuor viduo remanentia
eupli. orca port morum viri donec dos ei fuerit assignato, and qualiter doa sit
assiguando (see f. 96 of V). It may perhaps be argued that the rubricator
copied his rubrics from those which he found written at the bottom of the
pagos, the difference between the two sets being accounted for by the fact
that he shortened the sentences or changed the order of words to make them
the more easily fit into spaces which had been reserved for them in the body
of the text. This is possible, but not at all likely, especially as he inserts two
rubrics, cui and ubi, for which the guides at the bottom of the page gave him
no authority and for which no space had been left. Y is written in three
