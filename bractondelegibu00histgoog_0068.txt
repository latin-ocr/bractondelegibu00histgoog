BRACI'ON: DE LEGIBUS

half a column of blank space in which is written, “Et sciendum quod titulus
de homagiis faciendis et capiendis secundum differentiam tenementorum debet
continuari hic cum suis paragraffis sequentibus et durare usquead titulum
proximo hic sequentem.” Here the title corresponds to a chapter in the
printed book. The principle is clear enough. Bracton’s titulm is to represent
some broad, leading subject; his paragraphua¹ one of the larger single
divisions of text treating of a subtopic of the title. This is his plan in
general. Different subjecta will require different treatment in detail, titles
will vary in importunes, paragraphs will be long or short, the purely English
law with its forms of writs and references to cases will present a different
appearance from the quotations from Azo‚ absolute uniformity it will be
impossible to attain; but to the very end of his book we shall find him
following this method of choosing a main subject and discussing it under the
heads into which it naturally falls

This plan he has adopted “without prejudice against any better method.”
By these words did he merely wish to imply, in a broad-minded sort of way,
that there might be schemes better than this he was to follow or is there here
a tacit acknowledgment that his system is not that which most of his readers
would be likely to consider the bestl The words are open to either interpreta-
tion. His arrangement was not the usual one for a work of this sort, nor was
it the arrangement of the models upon which he depended. Without going
into a full discussion as to the various books from which Bracton may have
borrowed matter, suggestions, or inspiration for certain parts of his work, it
may be pointed out that those to which he was principally indebted were the
Roman law books and the English Glunra‘ll.¹ All of these had in their plan of
arrangement something which he was not following—a division into books. Is
not this the “melior sententia’' of which he is thinking? Το go back again to
his own words. He is about to write a Summa. That is all he needed
to have said; he could have ended his statement there; any one who read
would have understood what he meant. Yet seemingly he feels the necessity
of going further and explaining that this Summa is to be arranged in a certain

way, but that his adoption of this plan must not lead the reader to believe

¹That the paragraph continued to be regarded for aomo time after Bracton aa thebaeis of the smaller
divisione of the treatise would seem to be proved by the following passage from lic, f. 28. Naar what lu the
printed text is the beginning of sect l, f. llb iss “hic eat plus quam iu alio a paragrapho Item notandam usque
ad paragraphum ln edendam qaod por ea ipram. . . . . '’ (Cf. 11. 10-11, f. 41 of V.) Α similar uae of the same
word occurs on f. avb of MC, and in both instancea the reference is to the addam which the liat of addioiom
below shows are found in this portion of the treatiae. Compare this with the terma used in OM at the begn'nulng
of the table of contenta-“Incipiunt tituli tractatus domini Hauricl de Brattone. . . . ”

' The subject of Bracton’a library ia considered in Braetoa aad Aw, xxiv-xxvi.
