PEDIGEEE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

the more general relationship of the particular manuscripts under discussion
is by the following variants: perfodiat (fodiat), MA, ΜΒ, MD, ΜΙ, CM,
LC, (ΟΜ, HA, W; evaserint, MA, MD, ΜΙ, CM, LC; comerent, ΜΒ,
†OB, LG; invaserant, OM, HA, W, ÷gr0up(111); invaserint, group (ΙΙ).
ΟΜ and HA are more closely connected with each other than with W.
Omissions in all three of these manuscripts produce a system of checks which

prove conclusively that no one of them was copied from either of the other
two

The graphical representation of the relationship in group (Ι) will be
different from what it was for fs. 88h35. MN omits this later passage3 CF,
LT, CC, ME, go over to (ΙΙ); OM, ΜΙ, CM, LC, HA, W, come over from
(ΙΙ); MF, Ρ, Y, go over to (ΙΙΙ).

In (ΙΙ) OF, ΜΩ, ΜΗ, ΜΚ, CB, LB, ΗΒ, remain assor facab-35,
while ME and CC group themselves with MH and LB. The pair groups OF,
MG, and CB, ΗΒ, are again prominent. CA and X, which because of the
excessive number of their variants are easily the poorest texts of all, form
another closely related pair group. CF and ΒΤ likewise make a very poor
