Inserted aster tabet, l. 28, 1. 401), with ll. 46-2, 11. 41-41b, preceding, in MH,
CM, and OM, LB, B (which mark additional); aster duranum, l. 6, 1. 401), in
MD, OC (marks additional). The facts given in this and the two paragraphs
immediately preceding mean that the whole 11 sect. 8 is additional, the
passage being divided by different manuscripts at different points. There
may be here either one long additio, or two addicimrca which in some 11 the
manuscript texts have been brought together. The division 111 single additio
into two parts would be more likely to happen than the joining into one 11
two such passages, though under certain conditions 11 juxtaposition this latter
change might easily take place. We ean be sure that at one time all 11 this
stood in the margin—only marginalia would find so many different testing
places in the body of the text. The evidence already at hand tends to assign
it to Bracton3 the passage itself is so long that the collation 11 11 may be
trusted 1ο determine its origin.

folios of the printed text is missing iu MC at this point This passage has all
the earmarks of having come from Bracton, but it is not possible to get
positive assuranoe on that point

on the part 11 John 11 Lexington.
