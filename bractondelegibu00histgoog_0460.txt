BRACFON: DE LEGIBUS

cap. XXII), MA, ΜΒ, ΜΟ, MD, ME, MF, ΜΗ, ΜΙ, ΜΝ, CC, ΟΕ, CF,
CM, P, PH, LT, LC, X, Y. Inserted at the end of cap. XXII, 1. 521), in
OG, OE, OM, W, ΜΟ, MK, LB (marks additional), LD, CA, CB, Β.
Omitted in OA, LA, ML, LF. On the evidence of the manuscripts 1111111-
selves, we can not bnt regard this as a passage from Bracton.

F. 5711, 112-5. Etsic proferre. . . . per eaden verba. This passageis
omitted by the manuscripts in group (l), but is given regularly in the other
lines. Iu omission in (Ι) is in all probability due tn the copyist of the
common ancestor of that group mistaking the per eaden verba in l. 5 for the
same words inl. 2.

F. 5911, 11. 9-12. In boc passu 11111111 . . . . sit 11 pmsessionc. Omitted
by the manuscripts generally. Clearly from a source other than Bracton.

Fs. 59b60, ll. 45-8. Sed et diversa. . . . plenius 11111111. Omitted by
the manuscripts generally, for which reason it may not be ascribed to Bracton.

F. 65b, ll. 1-4. Et ad boc. . . . et retinuit. Regular in OB, OD, OE,
OF, MA, ΜΒ, MD, MH, MN, CE, CM, Y, ΜΕ. Inserted at tbe end of
cap. XXIX, f. 68b, in OC. Marginal in OA. Omitted in MC (partially),
LA. A typical reference tn 1 case, in the Note Book No. 003. The same
case is cited, not in an adda'rio, on f. 031). Apparently from Bracton.

F. 65b, ll. 19-24. Poscant 1111111 esse. . . . propinquitas arcemanus.
Regular in OB, ΟΟ (marks additional), OD, ΟΕ, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΟ, MD, ME,
ΜΝ, ΟΕ, ΟΜ, Υ. Marginal in OA, LA. This passage is clearly from
Bracton.

F. 67, 11. 2-11. Et notandum quod. . . . per 11111111 decentiores. Regu·
lar in OB, OC, OD, OF, ΟΕ, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΟ, MD, ME, MN, ΟΕ, ΟΜ, Υ.
Marginal in OA, LA. This is certainly from Bracton. Though it has every
appearance of being an asterthought, a question as to its ever having stood in
the margin of the original may well be raised.

F. 6711, ll. 10, 11. ld est. . . . antecessoribus. Regular in OB, OD,
OF, ΟΕ, ΜΑ, ΜΒ, ΜΟ, MD, ME, MN, ΟΕ, ΟΜ, Υ. Omitted in OC,
LA. Marginal in OA. This has the appearance of an asterthought by
Bracton, and the strong support given it by the manuscripts still further
increases that impression.

F. svb, 11. 16-18. Etfrater antenatus. . . . fratres praemortui. Regular
in OB, OD, OE, OF, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΟ, ΜΙ), ΜΕ, ΜΝ, ΟΕ, ΟΜ, Υ. Omitted
in OC, LA. Marginal in'OA. This passage must be put on the same basis
as the addieio immediately preceding.
