BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

When differenees occur they may many times be aecounted foras mistakes irr
the Azo which Bracton was using. Itis byrro means necessary to always
regard them os copyists’ errors in the De Legibus. It is better to have
Bracton say what his manuscripts make him say, even when that is contrary
to Azo, rather than alter the text of the De Legibus to conform to the printed
text of the Summo.

A study of the De Legibus brings with it the conviction thot Bracton
spent considerable time irr the work of revision without being ableto firrish
his book. There is every indication that an original first dralt, fairly complete,
and itself in no ways meager piece of work, was gradually exponded and
filled out in places. For a number of years, some ten or twelve, perhaps, or
even more, the author kept adding a mass of afrerthoughts, or additions, to
what he had already written. That this revision leit him no time to carry out
all that the very comprehensive early plan called for is suggested by the
general air of incompleteness in the last part of the book. We are forced to
believe that the work grew larger, not smaller, as Bracton worked over it, and
that the copy which he lest when he died in 1268 was very different from the
original dralt from which that copy had grown¹

This gradunl development of the Dc Legibus must be carehrlly considered
when the subject of the different traditions among the manuscripts is under
discussion. For even in his lifetime, while he was yet working over it,
Bracton may have allowed a copy of his book to have beerr made. Or it is
possible that the margins iu his original dreit became so filled with additional
matter that he was forced to have the whole copied into a new book with fresh
margins for more asterthoughts. In this latter ease the original drait might have
been used as an exemplar by some scribe aiter Bracton’s death. In either one
of these cases the‘manuscripts which would-descend from such a progenitor
would inevitably be different in some respects from those whose ancestor had
been the more finished work as Bracton leit it. There is no doubt that the
ancestors of (ΙΙ) and (ΙΙΙ) were copied from the revised De Legibus once in
Bracton's possession. There is a considerable mass of evidence which strongly
suggests, if it does not prove, that the common parent of the manuscripts in
(Ι), or more correctly the nucleus of (Ι), had been copied from Bracton’s own
book before the revision was finished, or from an early droit not fully revised.

A cumbersome number of facts which help to bear out this last statement
could be brought together, but it will be sufficient for purposes of illustration
