BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

In the case of abbreviated texts, such as CD, CH, CI, LE, eto, where
the readings are often entirely different from the real De Legibus, no'general
collation has been attempted, though here and there a passage has been
compared to show the kind and degree of difference existing.

Before attempting to interpret the text collation in terms of a pedigree it
is necessary to consider certain facts of a palaeographical nature connected with
the Bracton manuscripts. These facts have to do almost entirely with
questions of pedigree‚ and not with the matter of acorrect text. As far as
the actual handwriting is concerned‚ the reading of the manuscripts is easy
enough; nor are there many passages in which the meaning of the text is not
clear. From the textual standpoint the palaeography of the copies is not im·
portant one way or another; but when we are studying the variants of collated
passages for the purpose of establishing the lines of descent, it becomes a
matter of considerable importance.

A surprisingly large number of variants are of atype which we may call
“non-detenninative‚” variants of such a nature that they help but very little
or not at all in determining the relationship of the manuscripts. These non·
determinative variants are due to a variety of reasons but are all alike in this,
that they spring from causes so general in their operation as to influence all
scribes to make the same sort of mistakes, irrespective of the exemplars from
which they may be copying. Variants of this character have to be disregarded
for the most part when genealogical evidence is being sought for, because they
are too inconclusive and untrustworthy. Το be sure, a variant of this sort
found in the head ofa family line might be perpetuated in the progeny of that
manuscript; but it might be found also in representatives of many another line.
When looked at from every side and every angle, the only thing they definitely
tell us is that given the same or similar conditions for their copying, different
scribes were nearly certain to make the same, or similar, mistakes.

Of the causes which produced them the primary one was in all probability
poor light. Any one who has worked over manuscripts inan unlighted library
in the ever-falling gray light of a day in late autumn or winter understands the
effect of poor light upon the written page ofa medieval book. It is incon-
ceivable that all the early copies of Bracton were written by their scribes always
and only in the clear light of a bright day. Oiten on a dark day, or in late
