THE ADDICIONES

different families of manuscripts or at different places in representatives of the
same family. How far-reaching this difference is at times it requires hardly more
than a glance at the list of adda'dones to show. In answer to the question as to
whether such regularity or irregularity of position proves anything in regard to
authorship, it must be answered that no connection between origin and
position can be discovered. All the addidooea from every source were
doubtless at first in the margin. Presumably, also, most of them had some
mark which indicated at what point in the text they were to come in. A
fairly large proportion of the additiones found in the margins of the extant
manuscripts are thus marked. On the other hand, many have lost their place
marks, or have been marked by later hands, sometimes more than once and
with contradictory directions. Often they stand opposite, or nearly opposite,
that place in the text to which they belong. But. it is surprising to find how
osten this is not the case. If the side margin was narmw, or the addieio of
more than usual length, the scribe may have been forced by the demand for
space to begin at the top of the page. Sometimes so much additional matter
was connected with a page of text that the marginal space on that page was
not large enough to hold it all and it had to run over to the sides or bottom of
the next page. This usually occurred where several marginal additiones
followed one another in quick succession. Itis apparent, too, that some of
the scribes preferred the bottom rather than the side of the page for these
passages. Such conditions existing, it is clear that if the directing marks
attached to an addida in the margin were lost, the passage when taken from
the margin of an exemplar into the main body of a new copy might linda
resting place anywhere within the limits of that portion of text which covered
the page on which it stood. So it has come about that different additiones are
found indifferent texts at points far apert. Not infrequently these points are
so widely separated as tolie outside the limits of two whole folios in the
printed book. Addiciones which had lost the distinguishing marks of position
had a tendency to gravitate to the end of those titles or paragraphs to which
they seemed most directly to apply. In this connection it should be kept in
mind that the points of lesser division in the text vary greatly in the different
manuscripts. Points which are in the midst of paragraphs in some texts are
at the end of paragraphs in others. Thus MA and ΜΒ, for instance, often
have clearly marked new divisions of text at places where V and the addicio-
bearing manuscripts in (II) insert addiciones without the slightest indication of
a break in the text. It will be noticed when the list of addideram is studied
