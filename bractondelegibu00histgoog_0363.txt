 

PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

expedieucy or necessity demanded. But there is no adequate proof of this.
Itis, however, a supposition which would make possible the solving of some
of the worst puzzles in the pedigree of the manuscripts. Some of the codices
have corrections in a contemporaneous hand which are of such a nature as to
suggest that as soon as the copyist had completed the book, his work was gone
over by a sort of examino, who corrected mistakes and supplied inadvertent
omissions. In a scriptorium such examinations, at least of a cursory character
to discover any great discrepancies were usual. Under the conditions which
we have supposed, it might happen that the newly finished book would be
compared with some manuscript other than that from which it had been copied.
If a series of such corrections were copied and recopied in a number of manu-
scripts made at the same place at about the same time, it would result in just
such contradictions of traditione as we find existing in some of the extant early
copies of the De Legibus. Fortunately it is not hard to pick out the better
texts in (IV), but the exact positions of all the members of this group in the
family trec no one diagram will be able to represent.
