PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

enactment aster 1272 made increasing portions of Bracton's book more and
more out of date. So we get shortened Bractons, mere epitomes of the
original, some of them, which finally come to be hardly Bractons at all, but
osas much use to their ownerS, perhaps, as the longer treatise would have
been. These abridgments are of all sorts. One type is represented by LF, in
which the cases and writs are regularly, and some other parts occasionally,
omitted; OG illustrates another type which adheres closely to the language
of its exemplar in those parts which it copies, but omits large sections seem-
ingly at random. Much that was first omitted in OG has been inserted later
in what is really a second division of the manuscript, making it appear that
the first abridgment might not have been altogether satisfactory. CH, CD,
CI, all represent the type in which excessive abridgment has made the text so
unlike Bracton that collation is at best difficult, and in many places next to
impossible. Among the abridgments must be included Thomton's Summa
(see LE above), Fleta, and the popular Britton in AngloFrench-though all
of these are attempts at rejuvenating and modernizing rather than shortening.
The Summa Cadit Assisa, quite extensively copied in early fourteenth century
collections of legal writings, is the rearranged text of a portion of Bracton
with the language unaltered. To this list should also be added the Magna
Summa of Hengham.¹ These compilations were made by or for individuals
who were doubtless not all moved hythe same motives in cutting down a
work of recognized value, but many as the various reasons may have been,
the fimdamental one was clearly the excessive length of the parent treatise.
Two points in regard to these abbreviated Bractons should be noticed.
First, that they are decidedly unprofitable in the work of establishing a pedi-
gree, as they are in textual matters requiring much time for examination and
yielding but little evidence. In the second place they show, just as tnrly as
the large number of unahridged manuscripts, that Bracton was exceedingly
popular. Fisteenth centmy legal opinion has handed down to us the express
statement that Bracton was never considered an authority in English law.⁹
Be that as it may, it speaks well for the esteem in which the Dc Legibus was
held, that instead of passing it over altogether, or of substituting for it a copy

of the more modern Britton—itseli based on Bracton, and probably more
