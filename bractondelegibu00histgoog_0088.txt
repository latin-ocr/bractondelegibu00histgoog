after all. Though practically useless in themselves alone, when taken in
conjunction with information to be derived from other sources, they offer a
possible explanation as to why so many of the codices have chosen the same
large porticus of text for transposition, and, in addition, throw considerable
light upon some questions to which the peculiar construction of one of the
best of the manuscripts gives rise.

That manuscript is OA. The immediate connection of ΟΑ with the
situation is most visible in the fact that it omits Dower. Those copies which put

the treatise on this subject near the end of the book or omit it entirely were
seen to be OA, OF, MG, MK, CB, B, W. By consulting the collation of

the last piece of text below fs 413-415b‚ OA, OF, MG, MK, CB, CC, B,

X, will be found to constitute a single group closely related in this particular
portion of their contents. This does not necessarily mean that they continue
to agree for some twenty-five folios further on, but the presumption is that
most of them, at any rate, do. In other words, OA at the end of the book is
related to most of those copies which have the Action for Dower out of its
usual place. Leaving this subject for the present and continuing with OA
along another line, it will be found on examination that in the Bodleian manu·
scn‘pt the blocks of text marked off in the other manuscripts coincide with
new quires and new hands Thus fs. oab-98 of V form quires F and G in OA.
The disposition made of this part of the treatise by ML, CB, LD, LE, LF,
has been noted already. Fs. 11-6ab, which ML puts with fs. oab-98 at the end
of cap. XXX on f. 439 of V, form quires C, D, Ε, of OA. Quire R of OA
begins with the “praemortuorum‚’' etc, off. 262b‚ which thus associatos itin
some way or other with ML, CF, CC, LT, LA. Dc Actioaibaa begins quire H
of OA. Clearly the important manuscript in this discussion is ΟΑ; it seems to
hold the key to an easy solution of the problems which have been brought up
by the variation in the order of subjects. However, before its relation to the
π other manuscripts is considered it will be necessary to examine ΟΑ itself.

In a way this is a digression from the subject immediately in hand,
but it brings up a topic which must be discussed somewhere in this connection,
and which can be treated to the best advantage at this place. No less an
authority than the late Professor Maitland has made the written statement

that in the particular arrangement of its material by quires ΟΑ is reproducing

some of the external traits of Bracton’s original manuscript.¹ Manifestly,

² Broctoa aad Aac, 989-948. His attitude towards ΟΔ is wall expressed by a sentence in the first
paragraph on ·p. asc-“At present I think that it may well be a primary copy of tha original MS„ and that it
may reproduoe some exterual, or (if 1 may uso the phrase) anatomical truita of its parent.”
