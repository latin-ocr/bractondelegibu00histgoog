f. 1321), in MD arrd ΜΕ (preceded hythe oddioa'o on f. 1321), 11. 21-30); at the
end of sect. 13, 1. 1331), in OB, ΟΕ, MA, ΜΒ, ΟΕ, OM, X. Marginal in
OA, LA, Y. Omitted in OG. Manifestly an addicto from Bracton. For a
discussion of this addicto, based orr the variant readings in the manuscripts,
see above, p. 356.

F. 131, sect. 19. The rubric forthis sectionis made a part of the text of
sect. 18 in some manuscripts, though in most codices it is given as a rubrio or
omitted altogether.

F. 135,11. 22-25. Nec deodoodo . . . . docere poterit. Regular in OB,
OD, OE, MA, MB, MC, ΟΕ. Inserted alter eius, l. 25, in OF, CM, atter
air, l. 31, in MD. Marginal in OA, LA, Y. In all probability from
Bracton.

F. 135b, ll. 5-6. Vel eu parte. . . uanum. Regular in OD, MA, MD,
ΟΟ. Inserted alter matris, l. 4, in OB, ΟΕ, OF, MB, MC, ΟΕ, CM.
Marginul in OA, LA, Y. It is barely possible that this is an omission (due
to the recurrent eu porte mettre) instead of an addicto. Bracton is undoubtedly
the author.

F. 136,1. 33. Cum sit latro publicus monime. Regular in OD. Inserted
aster molan a't, l. 32, in OB, MA, MB, MC, MD, ΜΕ, ΟΕ, LA, Y.
Marginulin OA. Used asarubric in OF, MH, ΟΕ, LB. Omitted in OC,
CM. Apparently the very brevity ο1 this addicto caused some of the
scribes to regard it as a rubric. The presumptionis that it came from
Bracton.

F. 136b,11. 13-14. Et uolturios . ‚furandi Regular in ΟΕ, OF,
ΜΟ, ΜΗ, ΜΙ, ΟΜ. Inserted atter deba, l. 12, in OB, MA, ΜΒ, MD, CB;
atter praebeot, l. 17, ME. Marginal in OA, LA, Y. Apparently omitted in
OD, OC. Though ofa somewhat doubtful nature, this passage hus probably

come from the author of the treatise.
Ε.1361),11.18-21. Sedbi....alossscarioas Regular in OA, OB, OD,

ΟΕ, MA, LA, MB, MC, MD, Y. Omitted in OC. In MH and CM the
first few words of the passage, through iry‘ortuoium, come immediately aiter
the addicto in 11.]3-11, the rest occurring regularly at the end of cap. XVII.
This must be ascribed to Bracton.

F. 1101), 11. 38-10. Nota quod. . . . ooo rubuere. Inserted at the end
ο1 sect. 3, 1. 1401), in OD. Used as a rubrio in OA, OC, ΟΕ, ΜΗ. Omitted
