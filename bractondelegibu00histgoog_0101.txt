PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

Again, on a roll of assises taken by Brscton in 1254 is a case between William
Montacute and Andrew Wake¹ On f. 101b of the Digby manuscript, in the
margin, and without context, is 11701111Μ111110110.ς Now the Note Book
itself does not need to enter into this discussi0n; there is no necessity of
determining here the debatable question as to whether or not the 0011010101
01 these cases in the Note Book and Bracton are one and the same. Nor is it
necessary to consider at this place the significance of the marginal Cusus or
Nota casua which are found over and over again in the Bracton manuscripts,
and are, indeed, among the most common of all the marginalia⁸ N or is the
question as to whether Bracton or some one else wrote in the margins of sn
earlier copy the Cusus Corbio and similar jottings which are found in OA
the point of most importance just now We are trying to determine whether
on account of these marginalia OA is given any position of preeminenee. An
examination of the other codices shows that it is not. These same names,
whoever may have been responsible for their appearance, are found in other
manuscripts and OA is not marked offas special and peculiar because of them.

In MC Cusus corbin has become part of the text at the place where
it is found in 0A.⁴ On page 283 01 PH, in the margin and at the same place
as in OA, is Wolce Montaguu. Other manuscripts than OA have therefore
these notes which have been so emphatieally approved. The Memorandum dc
casu dc 1111 Arondelle on f. 98 01 OA, which has been already alluded to,
does not stand in at all the same relation to the rest of the manuscript as the
Cusus Corbin and Wolce Monfago jottings. It is something quite apart by
itself, being written in a hand different from that of the text, rubrics, additiones,
or corrections, The writing is very similar to that of the J. de Beaupre note
onf. 1291).ὅ 11 was written in all likelihood by the owner, or by one who at
