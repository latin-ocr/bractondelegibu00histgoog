BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

Y and the-second part of OG have not changed their text tradition between

fs. laab and 161. MC and LA have not changed their general relationship
in the collation between fs. 118 and 161. In the longer and later passage
they frequently agree. Moreover, Y is several times found in agreement with
them. There can be no doubt that the connection between these three
manuscripts as shown by the variants on f. 118 continues through to f. 161,
though no such connection is apparent from the collation of the short passage
on f. 1821). Such a comparison of the two sets of passages, in spite of the
manifest shortcomings of the 'shorter, works out very well.

For reasons which have already been given, the addiciones have to be
considered apart by themselves, and the relationship of each addicar to the
text proper discussed separately.

Forty manuscripts have been collated for this portion 01 the text The
general variants given at the beginning show that there are three large groups,
the first two somewhat more distinct than the third, hemely, (I) ΟΒ, MA,
ΜΒ, MD, ΜΕ, MF, MN, CC, CF, LF, LG, LT, P,Y; (II) OC, OF, OG,
OM, MG, MH, ΜΙ, MK, ML, CA, CB, CM, HA, ΗΒ, LB, LD, LC, B, X,
CD, CH; (III) OA, ΟΕ, MC, LA, OD. (I) may be split up into (OB, MA,
ΜΒ, MD, MN, LF, LG), (ΜΕ, CC, P, MF), (CF, LT), Y; and of these the
first may be yet further subdivided into (OB, LF, LG), (MA, MD), MN,
MB. Though MD is clearly enough in the first group, and in a pair group
with MA, it yet agrees with (II) in some very distinctive readings—nam,
appositam, aut duplicari, etc. This trait of MD will be noticed in the other
collated passages and is due to its exemplar having been corrected bya
manuscript in the liue of group (II). Petot 0 0100010010 for petat occurs in
ME, CC, P, ΜΡ, Y, 1-ΜΗ, CM, MI, LC, LD, X, in group (II), the variant
in all probability having been transferred from one group to the other through
comparison and a resultant correction—or corrections. The exact relationship
of ΜΒ, ΜΝ, Υ, 10 not altogether clear. Group (II) breaks up into (OF, OM,
MG, MH, MK, CB, LB, HA, ΗΒ, Β), (Ml, LC, LD, CA, CD, CH), X,
OC, OG, ML; and these again fall into smaller groups of (OF, MG), (OM,
ΜΗ, 01000, HA), (MH, cn), (on, HA), (00, 00, 0), (00, 00), (nr,
LC, LD, CA), (ΜΙ, LC), (CA, LD), (CA, CH). At times ΜΙ, LC, MH,
X, agree with group (1) in variants which could be explained on the basis of
