BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

behind the rubrics to discover the relative merita of the two divisions. This
can be done most easily by the comparison of at least a portion of their
respective schemes

V begins its second book at the point where Bracton turns from the
discussion of the division of 'l'hings to a consideration of the ways in which
dominion over Things may be acquired. The words at the beginning, “Dictum
est supra.. . . Nunc autem dicendum est,” seem to mark a new starting
point in the text. They do, but not necessarily the beginning of a new book.
'l'hese arethe words with-which Bracton over and over again, throughout the
length and breadth of his treatise, starts a new subject. Four times in this
short first book we find chapters beginning with the same mode of ex·
pression as that with which this second book begins.¹ In a hundred and one
other places we may see the same words performing this duty of introducing a
new chapter. If Bracton were going to begin a new book anywhere in this
part of his text we might most reasonably expect it one chapter earlier, when
he turns from Persons to take up Things. He is following Azo’s Samma of
the institutes closely in this section of his treatise, and both Azo and the
Institutas begin a new book with the subject of Things. The reason why
V’s manuscript exemplars have made this non-Roman division at what is in
the midst ofa title of the lnstitutes, is because the main subject of the next
90 folios-De acquirendo reram dominio-begins at this point. If Bracton
himself had made the division, we fancy he would have followed more closely
the leading in Azo's rubrio, “Incipit (liber) secundus de rerum divisione et
adquisitione.”

'l'he third book of the printed text begins at a place where there is a dis·
tinet change from one subject to another. Bracton has treated of Persons
briefly, of Things at considerable length, and now starts on au entirely new sub-
ject, that of Actions. The point at which this subject begins is clear enough.
But where did the author intend to have it end? V marks out for it a
division which is at variance with the plan followed in many of the better
manuscripts3 yet this arrangement in the printed book is a logical one. More·
over, it is altogether probable that it is the correct one, that V, and not OA,

OB, etc, has divided the treatise at this place as Bracton intended.

¹Very often in the MSS. the chapters are not divided aa iu V. Where Dictum utsupra occurs in the
midst of a section in V there is often the beginning of a chapter in the MSS. Followiug at least some of tho
MSS. we would begin a new chapter with Dictacm eat ercpro at the eud of sect. 8, f. ab, with sect. 8, f. 43 with
cap. Vl, f. aa with eap.1x, f. 6(omitting new beginniugs at cap. Vll aud vlu), at cap. 1x and lla aad
at sect. 2, f. ob. “title” rather than “chapter,” should be the word used to designate oue of these larger
divisione of Bracton's text. 'See below.
