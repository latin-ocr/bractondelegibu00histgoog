PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

for the abbreviation of et.¹ We have already noticed the connection between
the variants arising from et, vel, and ut. This is explained partly by the fact
that one of the abbreviations fornel (merely an lwith a slanting line drawn
through it from the right) is sometimes made to look exactly like one of the

abbreviations for ct, whose simple sign is made in various ways by different
scribes, The other shortened form of vel (vl or al with the same stroke
through the l) may on occasion have much the appearance of utl The single
letter s with one kind of line through its base stands for sed; with a similar,
though not identical‚ mark at the same place it means secandam. Not only
are these two abbreviations mistaken for one another, but that for aad is some·
times taken for ai.⁸ Quod, qaia, quasi, qaoe, are all abbreviated by adding the
proper sign to the simple q. As a result of this similarity they—especially the
first two—are not always distinguished from one another by the scribes.⁴ More
or less connected with these are another troublesome set of abbreviations built
on the letter q. Qwith an a above isque-qwith along comma-like mark
through its base, from right to left, with a dash or simple curved line above, is
quem3 q marked with the same line through its base and with a above is qaom3
marked with the same base-line and with m above it is quantana· qm with an a
above means quam to most of the scribes, though some interpret it as quendum.⁶

lV. Abbreviations which from their very form are ambiguous. These
mean little or nothing definitely, and by themselves, and though their meaning
is usually clear to us because of the context, they gave abundant opportunities
for making mistakes to the copyist who was not troubling himself about the
context. Many of them represent the quintessence of abbreviation. For the
long word emunetudincm we get an inverted c (=coa) to which is added ana
with the simple curved line above.⁶ The manuscripts are undecided between
manifestam and manufactam the scribe of MG refuses to take sides by writing
an abbreviation which would apply equally well to either word-m over m

changed: ar for ot, 1. 34, l. 23 ot forat, 1.381),1. 11, vol for ar, f. 1611), 133, at for osl, f. aab, 1. a). Et and
ul are probably mora often confused than any other two words.
