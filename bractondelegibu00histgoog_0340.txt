BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

In its readings group (IV) is not associated with (Ι) because the latter
follows traditions all its own. But (IV) is related to both (ΙΙ) and (ΙΙΙ), the
question being with which of these two groups it stands in the closer connection.
The manuscripts which make up this group do not at the other places collated
come into a single combination. Nor do they, in the other places, follow any
single tradition, individually or collectively. MM omits considerably more
than one-half of the whole treatise and has therefore been collated for only the
last three passages. In these it seems to maintain the same relative position.
But the other eight manuscripts in this group are found agreeing with different
lines at different places They seem to occupy positions on the outslrirts of
the more usual combinatious of manuscripts with fixed traditions. For this
particular passage the position of (IV) is fairly well established. The variants
for the caseon f. 413 would seem to place it at once definitely on the side of
(111), for while (ΙΙ) omits the case entirely and (Ι) reads W. de Roleigd, (ΙΙΙ)
and (IV) agree on R. de Tordeby, which is correct. Yet what this special
point really emphasizes is not an agreement between (ΙΙΙ) and (IV), but the
fact of the individuality of groups (Ι) and (ΙΙ). For there is not a consistent
agreement between (ΙΙΙ) and (IV). By referring to the list of variants given
at the beginnings of the groupings for fs. lla-alm, it will be seen that iu
having patera de recto and contrario (IV) agrees with both (ΙΙΙ) and (ΙΙ). In
several other places where (IV) shows an agreement with both (ΙΙ) and (ΙΙΙ)
