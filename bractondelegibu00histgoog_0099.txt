PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

section three. ML omits the writ and leaves a space of three lines. ME
leaves a space of nineteen lines but gives the writ in section three. MH like-
wise has a blank space of nineteen lines at the end of section two, and CM a
space of seven lines, P leaves an interval of six unwritten lineS, following it
with the red ink rubric, “Breve si essoniatus surrexerit sine licentia quod
milites mittantur ad videndum si ita surrexerit vel non post languor.” ΜΕ,
ΜΗ, CM, P, will be found to be in close agreement in many places in the
passages collated. Their leaving a certain number of lines vacant on f. 358b
is no more thana family trait, so to speak. We have already noticed that
ΜΒ, CE, Y, leit a space for the writ expected on f. 300b; these same copies
also leave spaces aiter “alio modo coram tali iusticiario'’ on f. abab, ΜΒ of

four lines, Y of eleven lines, and ΟΕ of nineteen lines. This would indicate ·

that some relationship existed between these three manuscripts in this partic-
ular portion of their treatise. In the same way the spaces lest by OA and LA
on f. 69 can be taken to mean nothing more than that some sort of connection,
which is also made plain in other ways and places, exists between these two
copies. From the instances which have been given it is perfectly evident that
it was no unusual thing for a scribe to leave blank lines for an expected writ.¹
The leaving of such a space at one place gives to OA no more right to the
claim of reproducing a blank in the author’s own book, than similar spaces at
other places give to many other manuscripts.

The amount of space leit vacant by OA at one place or another is truly

unusual. But it results from the irregular manner in which the manuscript

was built up, and not from any extraordinary excellence in either OA itself or
its immediate ancestor. The blank spaces themselves prove absolutely nothing

¹ All but “Rex vicecomiti salutem,'' or “Rex vicecomiti salutem. Praecipe,” is usually omitted in the
vrit in cap. XXIV, 1. 909. Sometimes the whole writ is lacking. ln its placa spaces ol from two 1ο five lines
are found in several ο1 the MSS. Aa illustrating how such a space might be regarded by a copyist it is
interesting to notice that PH, which leaves twolinss empty, has in the margin, “The rubric is lacking.” Clearly
tbe scribe ο1 ΡΗ took tbe vacant space in his exemplatas the space left for a rubric. Attention may ba called
to another unfullilled promise ο1 Bracton’s-that ο1 tbe ligura to illustrate descent and relationship, on 1. (iob.
The printed text reads “in ligura superius picta,” but most of the MSS. have “in ligura inferius depicta.”
There is nottho least probability that Bracton ever drew such a ligure in bis own copy, but space is lest ior it
in several of the MSS. OD has aucha ligure on f. avb (seaTwiss’s edition, l, xxi-xxiii). OE leaves balla
column ο1 space, but makes no insertion. W inserts two short treatises on consanguinity. ME leaves espace
ο1 9911333131 13 regular. Near the end ο1 sect. 9, 1. 681), MF has two peges on the rubrica “Quibus modis
arbor de consanguinitate debet lieri” and “De triplici cognatione.” At the very end ol tbe same section come
four peges from Jobannes da Deo, with the arbor eomaapus'aitatir. Ml leaves a space ο1 99 linea, but inserts
nothing. LA leaves about half a page ο1 space in different, though adjacent, columns. LBleaves latinos
blank. ln the margin, iu same hand, is “bic depingatur arbor.” ln Lc 97 lines were originally left vacant.
At the bottom oi tha page is inscribed “Hic delicit ligura.” CC leaves empty 90 lines on 1. 98 and two-thirds
ο1 s page on 1. 98113 whole page oi blank parchment being found also on 13. assub). lt was only natural tbat
thaoopyists should often be puzaled by these promises which their exemplare did not make good. See aaa
