THE ADDICIONES

instance case addicimres which are similar to Bracton’s references in form, and
of which the case may be found in the Note Boot, will be seen to rest upon
what is anything but satisfactory manuscript authority. This is all the more
worthy of consideration because at other times additions which are in this
same correct form are clearly from Bracton. Compare, for instance, the
three consecutive case reference addicimus on fs. laab,142b,144b,0ne of
which cases is found in the Note Book and the others not, but all of which
are from Bracton’s pen. From whatever point we may work it is difficrdt to
explain the slender support given to some case addicioacs and the general
support given to others of exactly the same type if we proceed on the
assumption that all these references which have the same form must have
come from the same writer. And this is true in spite of the possibilities for
contradictions and differences¹ opened up by constant comparison and cross
copying.

Nor does an irregrdarity in form in any way denote that the citation has
been added by some person other than Bracton. The siud dc itincre ia
cornitulo Ebomvm onf. 322, siud inveniri poterit ia rotulo de termino on f. 3351),
ea responso W. de Ruleiglr et G. de Segravc facto Ricardo Doleat, qai expetiit
eorum emasiliom ia lmc casu on f. 357, are references more or less blind, yet
they are in additional passages whose authenticity is well attested hythe
manuscripts. The reference to Walter Muschet on f. 405, which is more
unusual still, is even better supported by the manuscript texts. Of all the
citations in irregrdar form, the one which would most naturally be regarded
as having come from Bracton (f. amb, Martinus ia banco anno saptiam) is very
generally repudiated by the different text traditions, though the case itself is
found in the Note Boola On the other hand, some of the references not in
the usual form have most certainly not come from the author of the main
text. Representative of this class of citations are those on fs.194b,292.
These two additiones also show that ΟΑ may have in the margin and OD in
the main text references to cases not inserted by Bracton. Taken as a whole,
the facts prove that an unusual form of citation can no more be depended on

to prove or disprove any connection with Bracton than can the more regular
forma.

The collated passages firmish three case reference addicimaas which should
be mentioned in passing, as the large number of manuscripts which have been
compared at these places make possible fairly definite conclusions. The first

two of these additions are important principally because they confirm what
