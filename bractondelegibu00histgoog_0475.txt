A THE ADDICIONES

ἱ Marginal in OA. Omitted in OB, LA, ΟΕ, Υ, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΟ, MD.
Seemingly an addinb belonging to (ΙΙ) alone, and therefore not from
Bracton. ·

F. 196, ll. 5-10. Etcamveras....d0miat1n V this passage is
duplicated in ll. 41-46, at which place it is found in OB, OD, OC, MA, ΜΒ,
MD, ΜΕ, CM, Y. Inserted aster ipsura, l. 87, in OF; aster iusticiarium,
l. 29, in LA, MC. Marginal in OA. Omitted in ΟΕ. From Bronton.

F. 1961),11. 35-36. Est enim sonus. . . . et sauros alterius. Regular in
OB, OF, OC, OD, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΟ, ΜΕ, LA. Marginal in OA. Omitted
in ΟΕ, Υ. This is accounted for by all three of the larger groups, and is
therefore from Bracton.

F. 197, 119-27. De libertate licet. . . . mairam. Regular in OB, OD,
MA. ΜΒ, ΜΟ, MD, ME, LA. Inserted afcerlrabueril, trutmonia
OF, B (marks additional). Marginal in OA. Omitted in ΟΕ, Y. A
passage vouched for by the particular manuscripts which support this has
almost certainly come from Bracton.

F. 1971),11.7-8. Sed nemo. . . . respectibus. Regular in OF, OC, MC,
MD, MI, LA. Marginal in OA. Omitted in OB, OD, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΕ,
ΟΕ, Υ. In all probability from Bracton.

F. 198,ll.11-25. Nec praeiudicabitur. . . . corneum partiam. Regular
in OD, ΜΕ, LA. Inserted asterrcbus sats, l. 12,1. 1971), in ΟΟ; asternatata,
l. 26, f. 1971), in OF; alter adano, l. 26, in OB, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΟ, MD, ΟΕ,
Υ. Marginal in OA. Clearly an addicio from Bracton himself.

F . 199, ll. 13-26. Vel iuratum. . . . uliud erit. Regular in OA, OB,
OD, MA, MB, MC, MD, LA, ΟΕ, Υ. Inserted after oausam, l. 9, in OC,
OF, CB. From Bracton.

F. 291, ll. 19-26. Cum aulem . . . . superflua Regular in OD.
Inserted after remanere, l. 35, in ΟΟ, ΜΟ, MD, ΜΕ, LA, CA; aster panci-
pio, l. 41, in OF, ΜΙ, B(marks additional). Marginal in OA. Omitted in
OB, MA, ΜΒ, ΟΕ, Υ. Another case of (ΙΙ) and (ΙΙΙ) vouching for an
addida from Bracton which (Ι) omits. ¹

F. 20211. 14-20. The writ. Regular in Y. All after salutem Is
omitted in OF; all aster Aoeape is omitted in OA, OB, ΟΟ, MA, MB, MD,
LA, CA; the entire writ is omitted by ML, OD, MC. PH leaves a space
of two lines between Proeopeand Postuertam, and in the marginis “Rubric is
lacking.” This looks as though some of the scribes had made an attempt to
fill in a writ which Bracton promised but did not insert.
