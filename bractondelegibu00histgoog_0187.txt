PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

for the abbreviation ο1 et.¹ We have already noticed the connection between
the variants arising from et, vel, and at. This is explained partly by the fact
that one of the abbreviations for vel (merely an lwith a slanting line drawn
through it from the right) is sometimes made to look exactly like one of the
abbreviations for ei, whose simple sign is made in various ways by different
scribes. The other shortened form of vel (vl or ul with the same stroke
through the l) may on occasion have much the appearance of nt.² The single
letter s with one kind of line through its base stands for sed; with assimiler,
though not identical‚ mark at the same place it means secondom. Not only
are these two abbreviations mistaken for one another, but that for sed is some-
times taken for si.⁸ Quod, quio, quad, quoe, are all abbreviated by adding the
proper sign to the simple q. As a result of this similarity they—especially the
first two-are not always distinguished from one another by the scribes.⁴ More
or less connected with these are another troublesome set of abbreviations built
on the letter q. Qwith an a above is qua· qwith along comma-like mark
through its base, from right to leit, with a dash or simple ourved line above, is
quarm q marked with the same line through its base and with a above is qoam3
marked with the same base-line and with m above it is quantana qm with an o
above means qoam to most of the scribes, though some interpret it as qaantom.⁵

IV. Abbreviations which from their very form are ambiguous. These
mean little or nothing definitely, and by themselves, and though their meaning
is usually clear to us because of the context, they gave abundant opportunities
for making mistakes to the copyist who was not troubling himself about the
context. Many of them represent the quintessence of abbreviation. For the
long word ommvetudiaem we get an inverted c (=oon) to which is added ans
with the simple curved line above.⁰ The manuscripts are undecided between
manifestam and manufactum· the scribe of MG refuses to take sides by writing
an abbreviation which would apply equally well to either word-m over m
