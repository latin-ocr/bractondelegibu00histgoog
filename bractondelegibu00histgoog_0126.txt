BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

given variouslyas inlegatum, utlagatus, inlegatus, dungalum, utlagatus, lulag„
inlagal„ utlaga, indagatio. Or take the even more remarkable case which
occurs on f. 418. ΟΑ and CC, OF and MG, CB, ΗΒ, and B, MK and X,
agree closely with one another in the same general group, while those forming
pairs, as here arranged, are even more closely connected. For the correct
dissum of the printed text MK has the abbreviation dirs.; X that of drach„-
OF, MG, CB, ΗΒ, Β, the shortened and ambiguous turmore while OA
and CC give the word in full, the former as decoctorem, the latter as desua-
toria. Some three or four lines further on these same manuscripts illustrate
the same point in their readings for the usual duanam· MG, X, having
disaerffloven OA, ducentorum· OF, MK, CB, Β, ΗΒ, 1111081041ῃά CC,
diss. As there is every reason 101 believing that in this part of their texts OA
and CC were copied from the same exemplar, and OF and ΜΟ from another
common original, we have here conclusive proof that some of the copyists took
such liberties in extending or abbreviating the text which they were repro·
ducing, that two scribes might get from one and the same model totally
different readings for the same word.

Leaving out of account those which were so regular in their formation,
or so generally recognized as meaning only one thing, that there could be uo
doubt asto their identity‚ we may divide the abbreviations into certain classes

or groups on the basis of those special features which caused them to be mis-

understood by the copyists. These groups arc:
Ι. The same abbreviation used for two or more different words. Vrd

with the proper mark aster it (vit) may mean either videt or videlicet,·¹ an i with

an e over it (11101άε01110111100111111·θ dn, as used by different scribes, may
mean dicitur, navum, or dividuum· an i with an a over it (ξ) may be taken

sorduistis, 01111οβ ltt' with a curved mark alter the i, may be either laih or
dattenuelt-⁴ un with a dash drawn above it (uri) may bc extended to either uude
or 1101110, pla with amark through the l (plu) is plura or placita,¹⁶ ae with the ur
sign over the e (al) may be written i‘n full as sequitur or acquantum-⁶ and so on.

² On 1. 4111), 1 48, we get videt, videlieet, υἱάσι, videtur, vide, iudicio, ee variante 10101άο0.
