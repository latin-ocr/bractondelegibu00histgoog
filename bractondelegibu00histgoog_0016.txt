PREFACE

pleasure to have to differ with the late Professor Maitland on these two
matters of the Digby manuscript and a division of the treatise into books.
Though it was not given to me to know him personally, in the plan for a new
edition of Bracton his influence has been at least as great as that of any other
one person. Ι have drawn on his writings and on the enthusiasm which they
have been able to inspire; it is in no spirit of controversy that Ι have taken
exception to some of his statements. Again, if some of my contentions in
regard to the additiones savor of heresy my plea must be that it is the evidence
of the manuscripts, and not I, that is speaking.

A not inconsiderable amount of space has been devoted to the collation of
the selected passages of text. This was not only justified but made necessary
by the importance of the collation, which, because of the vast amount of
evidence that it turnines, represents in some respects the most vital part of this
volume. No pains have been spared to make it correct to the least detail.
Though much of the work has had to be done at a distance from the original
manuscripts, this fact can hardly have affected the results arrived at in the
collation, inasmuch as a two years’ acquaintance with the manuscripts them·
selves at the beginning has been supplemented byavery free use of photographa.
For all but two or three of the more inaccessible manuscripts each passage has
been collated four times, twice in the original and twice from photographs.

In one way or another many people have had a share in the making
of this book. The encouragement of friends in a lengthy and laborious under-
taking has proved just as real a help as the assistance which has had amore
direct bearing upon the work itself.

Any work of this sort is rendered possible only through the kindness and
cooperation of those into whose keeping the original manuscripts have come.
My debt to the libraries has been great. Ι am most deeply indebted to the
authorities of the British Museum, the Bodleian Library‚ and the Cambridge
University Library‚ not only for the free use of the many Bracton manuscripts
therein contained, but also for the generously given permission to photograph
those manuscripts, a permission which, though many times asked‚ has never
been refused.

For the same reasons my thanks are due to the library authorities of
Trinity College (Cambridge), Trinity Hall (Cambridge), Pembroke College
(Cambridge), Merton College (Oxford), Eton College, and Lambeth Palace,
in all of which places Bracton manuscripts have been freely placed at my
disposal both for study and for photographing.
