PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

OA and MC. When this has been done for the whole text the connection
existing between these three manuscripts, which is not altogether apparent as
yet, will probably be made evident. OA and ΟΕ have good texts for the
most part, but deteriorata toward the end to such an extentas to be practically
useless textually. Each has peculiarities of its own, and both must be collated
until the poorer latter portion is reached. Just where this portion begins, the
collation itself will show. As far as the passages already collated are concemed
these two manuscripts show a good text on f. a1ob, but become very poor
when the next point of comparison, f. lllb, isreached. Somewhere within
¹ the same limits OD goes over from (ΙΙΙ) to (Ι), but the change does not
affect the value of its text to anything like the degree that OA and ΟΕ are
affected by their changes of tradition, and aster the transition it may still be
used to advantage, especially in cases of marked disagreement among the other
manuscripts in group (Ι). It is to be suspected that in OA the change from
(ΙΙΙ) to (ΙΙ) takes place at the point at which hand VI begins its lirst quire,
f. narb, as hands ΙΙ, ΙΙΙ, IV, V, are all represented in the first ten of the collated
passages which in this manuscript show the readings of (ΙΙΙ). However this
may be, the judicious use of OA, OD, ΟΕ, MC, LA, will make it possible to
establish the traditional readings of (ΙΙΙ) as opposed to those of (Ι) and (ΙΙ).

For (ΙΙ) the best representative, all things considered, is either OF or
MG. These manuscripts areos practically the same value textually (OF has
a table of contenta which MG lacks), and equally accessible. CB, B, ΗΒ, are
in most places closely allied to OF and MG. 0f these, either CB or B is
better than ΗΒ because the latter has been so affected by corrections in an
exemplar that its text does not show the peculiar traits of its own family line.
A more extended comparison would perhaps show that B was a slightly better
manuscript than CB, which is more immediately accessible than B, though
the kindness of the owner of the latter, who has at least twice very kindly sent
it where it could be freely consulted, leaves no doubt that it could be used to
any such reasonable extent as the making of a new text demanded. As
another member of this same larger sub-group, LB may be used in case of need,
though the loss of something more than a hundred folios of the printed text
makes it less usefirl than might be desired. However, if we may judge from
the passages which have been collated, it has the advantage of being a represen-
tative of (ΙΙ) throughout, in spite of the fact that it is written in at least three
different hands. LD appears to be the best representative of another braneh,
though in all places and in all its hands it does not follow the same tradition.
