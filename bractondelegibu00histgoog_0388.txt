BRACI'ON: DE LEGIBUS

Moreover, only two of its five or six different hands are represented in the
passages which have been compared, and from the work already done, there is
nothing which will indicate whether the scribes of these other portions have
followed the same or a different exemplar. Hand Ι gives every indication of

having been taken from a model in group (ΙΙ) and hand V of following an
exemplar which would be put in (ΙΙΙ). The work of the other scribes is so
little in amount as to be practically negligible-less than twenty folios having
been written by hands ΙΙ, ΙΙΙ, IV. One hundred and thirty folios out of the
two hundred and three have been written by hand I. We may, therefore,
regard LD for considerably more than a half of its contents as representing one
of the branch lines in (11). OC and the first partos OG, which istoo frag-
mentary for use, follow almost a middle course between (ΙΙ) and (ΙΙΙ). The
only text in (ΙΙ) which need be collated entire is OF-or MG. Where this
gives a different reading from either (Ι) or (ΙΙΙ), reference may be had to CB
or B, LB, LD, OC, the extent to which these other manuscripts should be
consulted being determined by the nature of the variant readings and the
importance of the passage in dispute. All of these manuscripts, and especially
OC, are relatively more important in the matter of addicimus than in that of
the text proper.

Three other manuscripts will be used to a greater or less extent in making
the new text. They are MM, Ρ, Y. The first named is only a fragment-
it amounts to one hundred and eighty of the printed folios at the end of the
treatise—but it shows up so well in those passages for which it has been
collated that it can hardly be passed over. P contains a text which follows no
one tradition, but in all the passages collated gives usually a good account of
itself. Though in places better than at others it can never be termed
decidedly poor, and for the long passage on fs. lla-415b, which because of its
length probably subjects the manuscripts to the most severe and fairest test, it
has the least number of variants of any of the thirty-five texts compared.
' MM and P also stand out as two of the best representatives of group (IV).
Y is kept from occupying a position of high excellence only hythe broken
nature of its contents; one out of every twelve of its folios, on an average, is
missing. It is written in three different hands, each of which follows a different
type of exemplar, but has a good text throughout. Considerably more than
half of the whole book is written in hand 111 and was copied from an exem·
plar of excellent¹ text, if we may judge from the passages which have been
collated from this portion of the work.
