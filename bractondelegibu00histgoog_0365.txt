 

PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

Tun Cuorcn or quuscmrrs

There is no one manuscript so superior to all the others as to stand out
apart from them as preeminent. In order to ascertain what Bracton originally
wrote, it will be necessary to select from the whole list of manuscripts those
whose composite text, aster each hasbeen judged and corrected by the othere,
will exclude the additional matter found in some, and supply the portions ’
omitted in others. In making this selection it is necessary to consider very
carefully the nature of the individual texts—their general goodness or badness
independently of the tradition which they are following—and the value of the
different traditions themselves.

First, as to the texts individually considered. lt need hardly be said that
the handwriting is no criterion of tbe text value; the oldest type of writing
does not in any way mean the oldest tradition or the best text, for a codex
written in 1400 might very conceivably have been taken from a better exem·
plar than one which was copied a centruy earlier. On the principle that the
poorest text is that which contains the greatest number of mistakes it is
possible by merely glancing over the collation to pick out a number of manu-
scripts which have very little claim to any degree of goodness.· But the
relative value of all the texts in this respect is not so readily apparent. Only
by counting the number of variants for each manuscript, distinguishing the
different kinds of mistakes, can an estimate of this sort be made. In every
text there are mistakes of two kinds-those which result from the faithful
copying of mistakes in an exemplar, and those which are due to the careless-
ness of the scribe or bis inability to read his model. The first of these would
include not only the variants peculiar to the tradition which the manuscript
follows, but also a number of usual or natural mistakes of types that seem
practically unavoidable in copying. They would be mistakes which the manu·
script would be sure to have with others in the same line. The other kind of
mistakes, out and out errors on the part of the copyist, would for the most
part be limited to his text alone, though a few might be found in other texts
as a result of different scribes having made identical blunders. In the lists
given below, an attempt has been made to separate these two kinds of mis·
takes, the figures in one column representing the number of times the manu-
script differs from the standard text in company with others, and the figures in
the other column showing the number of variants peculiar to the individual
codex. These figures, of course, have their limitations. For instance, it
