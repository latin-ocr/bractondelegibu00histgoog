umcros: DE LEGIBUS

omitted in ML (both as rubrio and in text), marginal in LA, Y; f. 1661),
ll. 20-28, in the main text of OA, MC, ΟΕ, Υ, (Ι), (ΙΙ), omitted in ML,
marginal in LA, Y. A comparison 01 these six additiones is valuable because,
as the figures in the list 01 additiones below will show, a much larger number
01 manuscripts than usual have been examined for each one 01 them. In every
instance the passage is omitted in ML and from the main text 01 LA. ΟΛ
and Y (this is Y,) also usually omit in the main text ΟΕ omits only two
out 01 the six, while (Ι) gives all the passages but one. In four of the six
places (Ι) 10 unquestionably right in giving the passage3 in the other two cases
a decision as to what is correct is not so easily reached. The first additio
on f. 16310 omitted by ΟΕ and Y in addition to OC and the rest 01
(ΙΙ). Το offset this, OD and MC, as well as P, LD, W, X, and a number 01
other manuscripts, support (I) by giving it. Nothing can be learned from
ΟΑ and LA, as they put 10 the margins all sorts 01 additiones indiscriminately.
And ML omits indiscriminately. The manuscripts are therefore about equally
divided on the question as to whether this passage belongs in Bracton.
Inasmuch as both ΟΕ and Y in this portion of their text omit passages which
are clearly from Braeton (see 10. 1611), 166, 1661)) 100 much weight must not
be given to the fact that they omit here. Removing these two manuscripts
from the discussion 10) the present leaves the manuscripts in group (ΙΙ) alone
to support the omission. This group usually gives the Bracton additions and
others also, still it now and then omits a passage which is so generally accepted
by both the other groups as to leave no doubt as to its authenticity. More
significant than the omission in ΟΕ and Y is the backing which (Ι) receives
from OD and MC. 'l'here is nowhere any indication that these two manu·
scripts 10 (ΙΙΙ) have taken additional (or any other kind 01) passages from (Ι).
Nor is this a place where OD could have borrowed from (ΙΙ), any more than
(Ι) could have borrowed from ΟΕ, Υ 0) (ΙΙ). Moreover, the fact that P, W,
ΜΕ, and other manuscripts support (Ι) 10 important. Turning to the passage
itself‚ it may be seen that the position given it in Vis not that in which it
logically belongs. It should come at the end of 'the next or second next
sentence. Ιο either case this would cause two consecutive sentences to begin
with incontinenti. This raises the question as to whether the omission in (ΙΙ) 10
001 (100 10 some scribe 10 the early history 01 that line having mistaken one
Incontinenti for the other—most naturally a second 10) 0 first. This would be
a very plausible explanation if there was anything to show that this sentence
ever had such a position in the text. Doubtless it 01 first stood 10 the margin
