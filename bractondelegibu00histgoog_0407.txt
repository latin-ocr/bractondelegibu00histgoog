THE ADDICIONES

line as the exemplar or from a manuscript in another line, and therefore may
be from either Bracton or some other source, or from several sources.

Before leaving this subject of the positions assigned to the additiones two
questions more should be asked: (1) What is the significance of the fact that
in some manuscripts additiones are found on separate slips of parchment which
have been inserted between the regularly bound leaves? aud (2) Why are the
additiones on fs. isbaab numbered by MD? Both these questions have been
carefully considered in the hope that they might throw some light upon the
authorship of the additiones involved. But no such light has been forth·
coming. If the facts which gave rise to the questions have any special or
hiddcn significaucc it is not discemible. LC has the largest number of additio
slips3 similar slips are found also in MI and LD. In every ease they appear
to have been inserted as an alternative to copying the additia in the margin.
This is the simplest, most natural, and almost inevitable explanation of
the circumstances. What the motive behind this was, whether the length
of the addicit made writing it on a separate slip easier for the scribe,
whether the owner of the manuscript preferred to keep its margins clear, or
whether the slip was copied from au exemplar at some distance from the book
in which it carne to be inserted, we have no means of knowing. The three
manuscripts which eontain these slips are very closely related in places as the
collation of their texts has shown. Moreover, all three of them follow different
traditions in different portions of their texts They therefore belong to that
class of manuscripts whose texts have been decidedly affected hythe compari·
son of two or more exemplars indifferent family lines. There can be little
doubt that these slips mean nothing more than that comparisons of texts have
been made, either in the manuscripts directly affected or in some of their
ancestors. With the exception of the addicto prima, which comes on f. 3, the
additiones numbered by MD (and given in the list of additiattcs) are those five
found on slips in LC between fs. labaab of V. All of these will be discussed
at their proper places in the list of additiones. At best they are of doubtful
origin. There is not the slightest likelihood that in this numbering MD is
preserving either the order in which Bracton wrote certain additions to the
text, or the order in which they should come. It has already been shown by
the collation of the text that MD belongs regularly with MA in group (1),
which is lacking iu additiones for this part of the treatise. It has been shown,
too, that MD contains both additional and repeated passages not to be found
in MA, having taken them from some manuscript related to OC. This is
