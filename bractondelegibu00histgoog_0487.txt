THE ADDlClONES

treatise. There can be no doubt that the writer of the eddredo, whoever he
may have been, took it directly from the Note Boole. But with the passage
omitted not only in (I) but also in ΟΕ, Υ, and OF, MC, LA, we can not be
at all sure that Bracton was the writer. As to the possibility of some annota-
tor after Bracton having made use of the Note Boolr, see above, p. 368.

F. 297,11. rto-42. Ut de itinere. . . . per rotun. Regular in ΜΕ, CM,
OD. Omitted in OB, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΟ, MD, MN, ΟΕ, LA, Y. Here are
cited two casae, neither of which is in the Note Boolr. The citatious are made
iu regular form, but the manuscripts do not support them in away to make us
at all certain that Bracton was the writer.

Fs. 297b298, ll. 41-2. Idem erit. . . . dotem obtinebit. Regular in MD.
Omitted in OB, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΟ, ΜΕ, ΜΝ, ΟΕ, CM, LA, Y. The proba-
bilities are decidedly against Bracton having written this.

F. 298, 11. 10-17. Si mulier dotem. . . . lidberti vaton. Regular in
ΜΕ, CM, OD. Omitted in OB, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΟ, MD, MN, ΟΒ, ΟΕ, LA,
Y. Two cases are cited in this addicio. Neither oue is in the Note Boolc.
The statements made in regard to the additio in ll. 89-42, f. 297, apply equally
well here.

F. 298b, ll. 10-20 and 20-82. Bt eodem modo. . . . de gratio and quia
· dotia. . . . obtinebit. These two passages are found in the manuscripts gener-
ally, but usually in the reverse order. It is difficult to tell which is really the
additional passage inasmuch as though B marks the first additional, the second

is omitted in LA. The collation of several entire texts may be trusted to
‘straighten out this matter.

F. aoab, ll. 82-88. Si quis in. . . . descendat. This is a mere repetition
of the first few words in sect. 7 following and is omitted by the manuscripts
generally.

F. 810, ll. {to-35. Erquodmola'er....filt2·1)ivae. Omitted in OB, ΟΟ,
OF, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΙ), ΟΕ, Y. Marginal in LA. Inserted alter per iodicium,
l. 24, in MC, ΜΕ, CM. The case is not in the Note Boolc. The citationis
regular in form, but in view of the many manuscripts which omit it, the
passage must, for the present at least, be put among those of doubtful origin.

F. 811, 11. 14-17. Secundam quod. . . . Picleedoese. Though marginal
an LA, this passage rs regular in oa, ΜΑ, ΜΒ, nc, nn, Mn, ΜΜ, cn,
ΟΜ, Υ. It is therefore obviously from Bracton.

F. 811,11. 2827. Sed hocintelligeodam. . . . deNossendeoe. Omitted
in OB, OF, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΙ), ΜΝ, ML, ΟΕ, Υ. Marginal in LA. Inserted
