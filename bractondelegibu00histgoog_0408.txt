BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

exactly the situation in regard to these numbered additiones. MA follows the
other representative texts in (Ι) and omits them. MD and OC agree—often
against all others—both as to the adelicia itself and as to where it should be
’ inserted. Inasmuch as this numbering refers to passages not found in the
family line of MD, and as it is not given in OC or in any other manuscript in
that group from some representative of which MD most certainly derived the
addicimus, we must conclude that the numbering goes no further buckward or
forward than MD itself. Both the slips and the numbers are significant only in
this, that they help in an unusual way to swell the mass of evidence which
gives positive proof that the comparison of one Bracton manuscript with
another was customary to an extraordinary degree.

When the subjectos the pedigree of the manuscripts was under discussion,
it was made clear that a manuscript might follow one tradition in its text
proper and quite another tradition in its addiciones, and that for this reason it
was necessary to treat the pedigree of the addetam as a subject by itself.
For ascertaining the relationship of the addicimus two possible sources of
information are readily at hand, (1) the passages which have already been
collated, and (2) the facts which are brought out by a comparison of the more
important and representative manuscripts indifferent family lines—which
comparison was a necessary part of the work of making a list of the additional
passages. By using this material we are able to study a few additiones
intensively and for all the manuscripts, and to study all the additium for the
most important manuscripts This should give us a considerable mass of
evidence bearing direetly upon additional and doubtful passages

The uddidonea in the collated passages can be considered to the best
advantage by taking up each one separately. That onf. 32b has been discussed
on p. 251 above. By referring to the facts there brought out it will be seen
that this particular addieio isto be found almost exclusively in manuscripts
which belong in group (11), in which the manuscripts keep almost exactly the
same relationship in the additio that they show for the main text. The
changed positions of ML and X withinthe group, and the transfer of MF
from (Ι) to (ΙΙ), need at present no further discussion, as it is quite clear that
all three of these manuscripts have derived this additio from some manuscript
in the line represented by the sub-group (M1‚Lc‚LD‚CA). The real
problem is to discover the significance of the appearance of the adacio in OD,
which is the only text in group (ΙΙΙ) to‘contain the passage. In the main

text OD, OC, MD, belong each in a separate group. For this adda'crb they
