PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPPS

fairly lengthy section 01 text. Added to this was the fact that the agreement
between some 01 the manuscripts and the text chosen for comparison was so
close that these particular copies furnished only a few variants of any kind.
This difficulty not even the collation 01 the longer passages was 10 (10 away
with entirely. For instance, by referring to the collation of fs. 413-41511, 11
will be seen that while some of the manuscripta, as notably OA and CC, OC
and ΟΕ, 11000 an excessive number 01 variants, others, and ML in particular,
afford hardly enough to supply the information which we are after. Moreover,
as the collation of this same passage proves, even those copies which have, in
their entirety, amore than usual number of variants may in some places go
for a considerable distance with very few, Thus it is quite possible that a
short passage might fail to give a correct idea of the relative number of times
any particular manuscript differs from the best text reading—an important
point, and one which must be taken into consideration, in estimating the
textual value of the different copies. It is 00 unusual thing to find among
the variants irregular or chance combinations of manuscripts. In a long
collation any danger from this source will be obviated by the larger number 01
regular combinations. As a case 10 point, in the collation 100 1. 41410 11 0111 be
seen that for one variant OC and ΟΕ, MA and MD, ME and ΜΗ, ΜΚ and
X-four pairs 01 manuscripts in four different lines—agree against all others.
On account 01 1110 length 01 the collation at this place there are enough other
variants to show beyond any doubt that this particular combination is not
regular; in a short collation, in which there might be few or 00 variants
showing the larger group combinations, a single chance grouping of this sort
might easily convey a wrong impression as to the relationship of the manu-
scripts involved. Again, only in the collation of a passage of considerable
length would there be any likelihood of discovering the repetition of a passage,
such as occurs in MD on 1. 414. It may 0001010 some that these longer
passages in themselves would be quite enough to satisfy the purpose of
collation, especially as they take in even more fully than the shorter selections
the questions of the oddidooes, cases, disputed passages and purity of text.
But the imperfectioris of the manuscripts render the long passages insufficient,
for some copies omit 000 00 01000 01 the three, while ΟΕ contains 001 a single
one 01 these longer sections 01 text, though it does have the shorter. More-
over, the descent 01 1110εο manuscripts which have been copied 10 different
parts from different originals indifferent lines can be discovered only through
the comparison of a number 01 scattered passages.
