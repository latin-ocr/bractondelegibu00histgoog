BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

some time aster the manuscript had been copied had charge of it. Its very
position, so unlike that of the other Carus—it is put at almost the very bottom
of the page and seemingly as far as possible away from the text—would
indicate that it was in fact a simple memorandum, jotted down by some
reader of the codex alter its completion. Whatever its origin it can not be
considered as coming from the exemplar of OA at this particular place. In
such a case it would have occupied a different position, and have been written,
if not in the same hand as the text, at least in that of the ‹aildicionaa1 Itis

difficult to see how its occurrence here might in any way be construed as
connecting OA with the Note Book.

These are not the only references of their kind found in the Digby codex.
On its f. 44, in the margin opposite a passage near the end of f. 80b of V, is
“Casus Willelmi de Matisco in Hybemia.” CF has the same thing at the
same place. In the margin of f. osb, opposite sect. 4, f. lalb of V, OA has
in red ink “De J ohanne de N ewenham.’' Moreover, other marginalia of a
like nature are found in other copies. On f. 84 of OB, in the same hand as
the text and opposite a passage near the end of f. 18 in V, is the marginal
“Casus de Grendel.'’ In the margin of PH, near the beginning of sect. 8 οη
f. 65 of V, is “Casus Ricardi Quintyn.’' In the same manuscript, near the
middle off. 20⁰ in the printed book, there is written in the margin, in the same
hand as the text, “Nota de Willelmo de Raleigh et Priore. '⁹ Again, opposite
the case in sect. 9, f. 234b, PH has in the margin and in the same hand as the
text, aword which is scemingly meant for “Crey.” In LA, written in the
margin by the hand which wrote the text, opposite line 39, f. 168 of V, is
Totcrsollc. There is a case by this name on f. 169b of V, and the case itself
is “noted up” in the Note Book.²

These annotations interest and fascinata us all the more because they
arouse our curiosity. Since the truth in regard to them can not be known
they lend themselves readily to all sorta of speculation. The real facts are so
far beyond our ken that there is nothing to prevent us from revelling in the
luxury of guessing, and that is always prone to confuse possibilities with
probabilities. What theories and possible explanations could not be built up
on the 33 lines of space aster the mbric “Casus de Jordano Wavasore” on

addicto rather than with the text proper. The question aa to whether the adunione in ΟΑ were derived from
a different source from that of the main text will be discussed later.
