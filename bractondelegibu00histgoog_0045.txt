PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

in the collation, p. 137 below. As explained by the reference in the foot-
note at that place, an original IIII had very early become XV, which one
branch of manuscripts had altered to XVIII by changing the abbreviation of
a following modo (three vertical strokes with a little o over them) into III.
Before long this difference resulted in XV alios XVIII appearing in some
codex. That it must have been an early one is made evident by its numerous
progeny, one out of every five of the extant copies having this variant reading.
An individual case of this same thing is the telo vel telas of CA, p. 150 below
On p. 159 the voce voci of LG illustratas the same tendency, aliua being
omitted.¹ Another proof of the comparison of texts is found in the way in
which attention is drawn to the fact that the oddicioocs are really additional
matter. Not only are they often marked by plus, addicio, or extro, but they
are even introduced by such statements as, hoec clausula oon reperitur in
quibasdam libras, plus continetur ia isto libro quam ia alio, lu'c est plus quam ia
olio. A study of the collated parts will show that some of the manuscripts
agree with one line in the text proper, and with another line in the addicioacs.
But the chief difficulty in the work of assigning each manuscript its proper
place in the family tree, lies in the fact that the great length of the treatise

olien led to its being copied by more than one scribe. Though some manu· ·

scripta, as OB for instance, may have the kalendar, text, and even the rubrica
in the same hand, an examination of the descriptions given above will show
that in considerably more than a third of the extant manuscripts the text
alone hasbeen written in two or more different hands That the size of the
treatise was responsible for this there can be no doubt. Circumstances osten
must have made it impossible for a single copyist to have completed the whole
work. In some instances it is clear that different parts of the work were
apportioned to different scribes who worked independently of one another,
perhaps simultaneously in some scriptorium. There are copies in which one
scribe follows another, apparently in the most haphazard sort of way, as where
in CD in the space of three folios as many different hands have done the
writing, one to the amount of less than a page.

But the important point in connection with these manuscripts written by
more than one hand is, as the collation shows, that often the different hands
do not agree in their family lines, showing that frequently the various scribes
