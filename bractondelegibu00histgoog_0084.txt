nancronz DE LEGIBUS

Drrraasnous m run Ortona or Pausuurmo Sursucrs

Having finished with this matteras to how the De Legibus should be
divided, we may consider the problems which center around a difference in the
order of presenting subjects. In by far the larger number of codices the order
is the same as that found in V, but in considerably more than a fourth of the
manuscripts there is a greater or less amount of variation from that order.

This variation results from certain bloclrs of text being either transposed or ·

omitted entirely. Expressed concisely the facts are as follows:

The text on fa. 11-98 is put aster cap. XXX, ilas) in ML. Fs. oab-
98 is put aster the Action for Dower‚ f. alib, by CB; aster cap. XXX,
flea, by LD, Lm aster “vel expresse voluntate‚” l.1, emb, by ML.
The text of fs. oab-118 is put aster the regular end of the treatise by LF. De
Actionibus follows cap. IV, f. 11, in ML; cap. XXII, f. 52b, in CA,’CD;
cap. XXVIII, f. oab, in CB, LD, LE.

The Action for Dower is omitted in OA, MK, W;⁸ it is put aster cap.
XL, f. 98, in ML, LD, LE 3⁴ aster “quod non ponit (potuit),’' l. 2, f. 436,
in MG, OF (both of which omit the rest of f. 436 and on through cap. XXX,
f489); aster a passage inserted in sect. 11, fileae-“sub conditione utin
statuto de westmonasterio Edwardi regis et fiat remedium per brevia in
eisdem statutis formata,” in B3⁵ in CB the greater part of this treatise is put
aiter the regular end of the book.

In connection with these facts, as having a bearing on another phase of
the same subject, it should be pointed out that a passage on f. asab of V is
made the starting point of a new folio, or quire, or hand, in several of the
manuscripts. On f. 92 of ML the Assise of Novel Disseisin ends. Following
at once on this, beginning a new paragraph, comes the “praemortuorum ut
videri poterit si fiat donati0,” etc, on that folio of the printed text just
mentioned. L'I', which is not altogether regular as regards the position of

² lt will be noticed that this point, at which eo many of the MSS. make lusertions, marks the end of the
civil actions.

¹ As all after f. eie of V is omitted in CA, we een not be sure thet fs. deb-98 were not Inserted later, as
ln LD end Lu.

'ln L'l' Uirum ends with “per iuratmn ualeam expediri‚” f. 296. The rest of thet pege le filled with
the beginniw of De inpressu. With the next folio comes De Aetione Dots'r, aud that pert of Entry which has
already been written le marked out. OG has folles missing at the place where Dower should come.

⁴ After the end of sect. 4, f. 98, OC has the first chapter of the Action for Dower. This is followed by
De Adtonitus. The first chapter of Dower is found later in its proper place.

⁸ OG has sect. 4, f. 63, come after a passage in rect 12, f. ⁴88b.
