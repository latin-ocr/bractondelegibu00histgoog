PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRII'I'S

is no indication that the relationship of the first five has altered from what it
was in the earlier passage, though the small number of variants furnished by
these good texts gives hardly enough information to make the exact lrinship
clear. MC and LA, OA and ΟΕ, pair off in a way, but the association is not
of the closest. The very failure of OD to agree, except in very unusual cases,
with (Ι) and (ΙΙ) puts it in (ΙΙΙ), but within the latter group it stands apart
by itself. Its variants are few, and follow consistently no one tradition. In
having qualitercumque for qualicumque it follows (ΙΙ). With the rest of (ΙΙΙ)
it has the distinctive invaserunt in l. 7, f. loab. It agrees with (Ι) in having
acum for cum. With OA, ΟΕ, MC, it has concedendo for contradenda with
OA and four manuscripts in (ΙΙ) it has pectora for pecora· lilre OA, MC, CH,
LG, it has manufactam for manifestam· agreeing with OG, Y, ΜΕ, ΜΙ), it
reads domim regie for regn. These last three variants are rather non-
determinative. But it is evident that even in determinative variants OD does
not confine itself to those of any one group. To some extent, at least, one or
more of its ancestors had been corrected by texts in other lines. ln itself it
has omissions which would not admit of the suggestion that it might possibly
have been the exemplar of any of the other copies in (ΙΙΙ). ML is another
manuscript which it is hard to place in an exact position because of its laclr of
consistent agreement. Attention has already been called to the fact that this
manuscript appears to have been taken by comparison from several exemplars.
Y, P, MF, are more closely related to MC and LA than to any other mem·
bers of the group. Y is the best manuscript of the three, and ΜΡ the poorest.
The latter not only brings in a whole page of extraneous matter—including
references to the second statute of Westminster—but has a rather lengthy
portion of the text, which is marginal in LA, in two different places, once
regularly, and once misplaced, as in P. In its second part, OG stands in very
close relation to Y. The outlines of the relationship in (ΙΙΙ) may be
represented thus:
