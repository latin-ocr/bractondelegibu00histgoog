BRACPON: DE LEGIBUS

The additio de cartas on f. 34, one of the most important in the whole
treatise, is found in all the members of group (II) with the exception of ML,
and also in OD, MD, ME, MP, Ρ (marginal). The significance of these facts
as bearing on the value of this addition itself will be discussed later when the
subjectos addicimws is treated in detail. Genealogically‚ it is evident that
the larger OF group contains the same manuscripts as in the two former
addiciones OD and MF agree with this group as to where the addit-io should
be inserted. It may be pointed out that the agreement as to the position of
the additional passage in this and the preceding addicta between OC, OG,
MD, and the group containing MI, LD, etc, indicates only that the larger
OF φουρ chooses a place for the addicta different from that in which it is found
in the other manuscripts. The sub-groups of the larger OF group remain the
same. MI, LC, again form a pair group, and LD, as usual, is in agreement
with them to form a larger group. CA and CH do not' show up in the
variants, but there is no reason for thinking that their position has changed.
OC, OD, OG, MD, show a general relationship, OC and OG being the
nearest to one another. P, ME, ΜΡ, are in some way connected with OD or
its more immediate kin. MF agrees with OD and the larger OF group as to
the position of the adelicia, while ME selects the other position in the text,
and P is marginal. This may mean that the passage in P was copied from an
exemplar related to both MF and OD, but the more probable explanation is
that P was copied—as far as the adda'av'o is concerned—from a manuscript
closely related to OD, and that ME and MF both derived the passage, either
directly or indirectly‚ from P, each of them choosing, aster a comparison with
other manuscripts, a different position in the main body of the text for what
in P was a marginal addition. Where OD agrees with ME in having nee for
nisi, MF follows P and reads ne. There is here the suggestion that P was
