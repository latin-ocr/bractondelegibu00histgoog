BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

criminal actions just as plainly form a section by themselves but the point at
which this subject branches off from that of Actions in general is not so easily
seen. In the first place it should be pointed out that the rubrics of OB, OE,
ete, which seem to answer the question so satisfactorily by putting all between
fs. 107 and 161 into one book on the general subject of the jurisdiction of the
kingdom, considered under the topics of the king, his. justices, the pleas of
the erown, have made a division which is specious rather than real. These
rubrics would apply equally well if OA, OB, etc, had begun the second book
two, yes, even four, chapters earlier, for chapter five is just as thoroughly
devoted to the subject of plens of the crown-English criminal law-as any
chapter in the following treatise of De Corona. Moreover, as has been
pointed out, the subject of jurisdiction begins before chapter nine. Professor
Maitland, taking OA as his model for this matter of a division into books,
deeided that the beginning of chapter nine would be a very natural place for
Bracton to have begun a new book, as being the point at which he turns from

’ Roman to pure English law.¹ But chapter nine does not mark that point.

Bracton begins his borrowing from Roman law at the very start of his work.
And almost from the start, sections that are thoroughly English follow sections
which are thoroughly Roman in their origin. In some portions the English
predominates, in other the Roman3 there are large sections in which the
balance between the two is nearly equal3 but for the first 115 folios thereis
this mingling of the two kinds of law. The treatise on Actions is made up of
alternate layers of law from the two sources. In the first three chapters the
matter is either largely taken from, or suggested by, Azo or the Institutes.
Chapter four is a mixture of both English and Roman material. The fifth
chapter is English law pure and simple3 the sixth is again largely taken from
the Roman; in the seventh, Bracton once more reverts to English law. The
eighth, at least at the beginning, is Roman. But Bracton's references to his
Roman sources do not end with chapter eight any more than his purely
English law begins with chapter nine. Chapter ten treats of the delegated
jurisdiction of the judges, their power, and how that power may be brought to
an end. Then follows a chapter, consisting largely of the forms of writs, on
the itinerant justices. Section one, and a part of section two, of chapter
twelve continue this topic of the justiceS, but the remainder of this last

² “He has run through the Institutas, taken them as his gulde, and borrowed frum them all that seemed
useful. . . . . The remainder of his treatise will indeed be devoted to actions, but he has now won his way to

sefe English ground, and in his arrangement of topica he will no longer be guided by the &man text book.
. . . . Nevertheless, there is a close connection between his second book and his first.” Bredas aad Aac, las.
