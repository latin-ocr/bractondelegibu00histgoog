PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

Novel Disscisin and the whole subject of civil actions is at chapter one, as in
V, and not as in OA and OB at chapter three.

F urther on other dividing lines in the De Legibus will be examined. It is
interesting to note here that the arrangement in V—so far as we have
examined it-is to be preferred to that which is found in some of the best of
the manuscripts. The authority for V’s plan rests upon only four of the
extant manuscripts, and they in no wisc the best.¹ Referring to the collation
below it will be seen that of these four codices OD and PH are related to one
another, and that CF and LT are even more closely related. But the two
groups are not related; one has come along quite another line of descent from
the other. They could not all, therefore, have derived this plan of division
from a common ancestor. One of the groups, at least, has horrowed it from
another line; both may have. The other members in the larger groups of their
respective families do not show the same scheme; it could not have come, for
this reason, from the fountain head of either line. So this arrangement which
V uses has, at the best, no more manuscript authority behind it than the one
in place of which it is seen to be preferable. In a way it has not as much, for
three of the four exemplars of V in this matter are not as good manuscripts in
many respects as those on the other side. This being so it might seem that
in upholding V in this particular we were preferring the inferiorto the better
copies. But it has already been shown that one codex is no better than
another in the scheme which it proposes for a division of the work into partS,
because each scheme was originally the peculiar property of a single copy, or
at the most of a single line, and does not go back to the common head of any
large group. The arrangement in the printed text has been preferred not
because it is supported by any manuscript or group of manuscripts, but
because it coincides with the plan of division which Bractou himself has noted
in his text. Why some of the inferior manuscripts have the better scheme is
a question which the evidence at hand will not answer. Whether their
arrangement was made earlier or later than some of the other schemes we can
not tell. Its basis seems to have been astudy of the text itsclf3 its value is
that from the standpoint of the text it is logical.

There is no evidence to show either that Bracton divided his treatise into
books or that he intended so to divide it. Nowhere does he use the word liber
in this connection. We have grown accustomed to talking and thinking about

the “books” in the De Legibus because of the way in which the first editor of

² MSS. like OC, which have been divided according to thia scheme at a late date, can not be considered
aa mactioning it.
