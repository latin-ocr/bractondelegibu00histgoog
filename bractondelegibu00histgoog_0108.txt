BRACI'ON: DE LEGIBUS

sure is that OA has been the cause of the variation in the other manuscripts
rather than the result of it. That is proven beyond the shadow of a doubt by
the fact that quire Q is written evenly, and full to the very end. There is not
the least probability that hand V in this quire was making up adeficiency in
the exemplar from which hand IV copied quires P and R. In such a case
there would almost inevitably have resulted some vacant space or unevenness at
the end of Q, for, as we have noticed, it was next to impossible to gauge the
exact amount of copy which would just evenly fill a quire¹ It is perfectIy
clear, therefore, that hand V was commissioned to write a quire beginning
with the Assise of Last Presentation, and that this quire happened to go as
far as “praemortuorum. '' When hand IV started in on quire R he was simply
taking up the work at the point at which hand V had left it. At some time
before the quires which now constitute OA had been bound together, the
intervening quire Q became separated from quires P and R, probably through
the work of hand IV being set aside by itself.² While thus set aside it, or
at least quires P and R, came to be recopied by ascribe who did not under-
stand that another whole quire should come in at the end of Novel Disseisin.
As a more or less direct result of this mistake there have come down to us
those manuscripts which omit Q’s portion of the text, fa. 237b-262b of V.⁸
Another result of this setting apart of the work done by hand IV was the
removing of quires Fand G from their proper place. Why the manuscripts
which have this portion of the text out of its usual position make such different
dispositions of it we have no way of telling, but it will be noticed that In every
case it is put either aiter the end of chapter XXX, f. 439, or aiter some other
passage inserted at that point. It is significant-also, as yet further connecting
hand IV with the situation, that by CB, ML, LD, LE, the text of quires F
and G is put in juxtaposition to the Action for Dower, either preceding or
following the latter. Now we should expect to find the Action for Dower in

OA at either the regular place or the end of chapter XXX on f. 439. Butes

² See above, p. 79.

'lt is quite possible, of course, that Q was copied in some place apert from that In which hand IV dId
his work. Even if copied in the same place the work of the two scribes may very easily have been kept apart
until the whole volume was ready to be bound

⁸ Due probably both to direct copying and to comparison of MSS. The latter process would result in
many queer discrepancies, due to indIvidual attempta at correcting or filling in omimions. Aa far as thia
particular portion of the text is concemed, at least four aeta among the extant MSS. are in some way connected
through copying or comparison. ΟΛ has the matter in ita single quire Qr CF, La, LT, omit; CC on ita f. lllb
ends with “auus alium feoffaverit,” l. 23, f. 961 of V, 99 linea of vacant space follow, the first column of ua Is
empty and the next column begIna with “praemortuomm,” etc.; ME and ΕΒ both end with the “auus alium
feoffaverit” as CB, ME leaving a space of'i lines and ΕΒ a space of one and one-half columna, aiter which each
begins with cap. VIII, f. 2619, ΜΕ on ita f. 194, and LB on the second page of a folio.
