 

THE ADDlCIONES

F. 288,11. 22-28. Per ltoc. . . capena. Begular in ΟΟ, OD, OF,
OG, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΟ, ΜΕ, MN, ΟΕ, ΟΜ, Y. Marginal in OA. Without
trying to account for OA’s treatment ol this passage we may safely assign it
to Bracton.

F. 2891),11. 27-28. Item noa uafflait . . . . illam defforcioven't. This,
apparently some later annotator’s note on the preceding sentence, is generally
omitted by the manuscripts.

Ε.251,11.21-22. Super msa. . . . recto. Begular in OA, ΟΕ, ΜΟ,
ΜΕ, ΟΜ, Υ. Omitted in OD, MA, ΜΒ, OD, MN. It is altogether prob

able that instead of being in any sense an audian this merely represents an
omission extending from one recto to another. (See text.)

F. 2581), cap. II, sect. 2. Most of the manuscripts have changed the
time of limitation in the writ to fit the law in the first Statute of Westminster.
See above, p. 158.

Fs. 2581)-254. OA has in the margin two passages-Sed mua plores se
faciant. . . . ignoraret, uliud esset and Ut salutar qaoe siat . . . . et aec inter
tales—which are omitted by the manuscripts generally and are not found in V.

F. 254,11. 2-11. Bccc vicecomiti . . . . teste, etc. Omitted in ΜΒ, ΜΕ,
MI. Marginal in ΟΒ. Regular in ΟΕ, MN, ΟΜ, Y, MC, OA, MD. This is
probably an omission due to the two teste, etc.

F. 2581),11. 4-2. thaod masa. . . . locus Marginal in OA. Regular
in ΟΟ, OD, OF, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΟ, MD, ΜΕ, ΜΝ, ΟΕ, ΟΜ, Y. Clearly
from Bracton; seemingly a part of the text proper. The case in this passage
is cited to illustrate the point brought out in the marginal note to case 47 in
the Note Boolr.

F. 2681),11. 2-85. Antecccsorir dudm. . . . stro Mantuam. Marginal in
LA. Inserted aster moriatur, l. 41, f. 268, in MC. Begular in OA, OB,
MA, ΜΒ, MD, ΜΕ, MN, ΟΕ, ΟΜ, Y. If this is an addicto it is a very
early one and from Bracton’s own hand.

F. 265,11. 29-88. Item primas sive . . . . continetur. Regular in OF.
Inserted aster heredia l. 27, in OC, MD; aster herede, l. 87, in OD. Mar·
ginal in OA. Omitted in OB, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΟ, ΜΙ, ΜΕ, ΟΕ, ΟΜ, LA, Y.
We can hardly accept this as an authentic part of the text.

F. 267, 1181-88. Quia si talis . . . . heredem Regular in OC, OD,
OF, MD. Marginal in OA, Y. Omitted in OB, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΟ, ΜΕ, ΜΙ,
ΟΕ, ΟΜ, LA. This passage begins with words typically characteristic of an
addit-im but notice that the next sentence begins with the same three words,
