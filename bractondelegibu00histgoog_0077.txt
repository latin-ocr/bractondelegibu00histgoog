PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

subjects are put into one group, and De Ingressa and De Recto individualized
in passages which begin the two latter subjects.¹ On f.105b there is a
reference to the Writ of Right.⁸ The Writ of Right ends civil actions real,
because as the author telis us “Placitum vero de recto ultimum sibi locum
vendicat in ordine placitorum.”⁴ If the plan outlined on f. 159b is to be
carried out these real actions should be followed by personal actions. The last
folios in the De Legibus are given up to this subject.⁵ Whether these few
words are all that Bracton wished to say on this topic,⁰ or whether he hed
projected a much longer treatment of it which he was not ableto finish, we
can not with certainty say.⁷ His main interest was in real actions, not in
pomonal, and to thern he devoted the greater partos his book. At the end
he may have wished to take up very briefly personal and mixed actions to give
afinished appearance to the worin⁸ The form in which the De Legibus ends
will always leave open the question as to whether or not its writer intended
ultimately to add more to it in this place. That question does not need to be
answered here. It is more to the point to consider the question whether the
last hundred folios in the section ol civil actions should be divided as in the
printed book into separate treatises on essoins, defaults, warranty and
exceptions. Itis very evident from even a casual examination that there are
certain parts of the text devoted primarily to these subjects. A closer study
will show that the divisions in V are again in harmony with the author’s
scheme, that Bracton considered these portions of the text as forming sorne-
thing complete in themselves, if not treatises on the same rank as that of
N ovel Disseisin, at least subtreatises under De Recto. On f. 329b is apassage
which marks out De secto as a separate treatise and hints at a later discussion

¹ F. 317 b-‘¹Dictnm est supra de cansa possessionis quae per assises et recognitiones terminatur. Nunc
autern dicendum de causa proprietatis ques terminatur per iuratam ex testimonio et probatione eorum qui
probare possunt. . . . ” F. seih-‘'Expedito tractatu de assisis et recognitionibus quae proditis eunt super
inre possessorio, ad saisinam propriam vel alicuius antecessoris ut de feodo recuperandam, et similiter expe-
dito tractatu placitorum de ingressu assequendo, consequenter agendum erit de placito super iure et
proprietate.. . .'’

'“Et de hac materia habetis plenius inira de actionibus civilibus in rem, super ipsa proprietate per
breve de recto.”

'For “placitum'’ in the sense oi '‘aedo'' see f. rori-“itt sciendum quod omnium actionum aive
placitorum (ut inde utatur aequivoce).”

⁴ F. 828.
⁸ Beginning with cap. XXXI, i. 489.

h ⁸ The last chapter in the book takes up the subject of mixed actions. Hera Bracton goes bacir again to
ia Roman sources.

⁸ Personal and mixed actions have been taken up before in cap. lll, f. loib.
