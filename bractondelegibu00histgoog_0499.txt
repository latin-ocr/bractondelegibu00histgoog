F. 4221), ll. 26-28. Quia cicc. . . . de feodo. Inserted after feodo,
l. 20, in OB, OA, LA, CB, MC, MD. In some manuscripts it is used asa
rubrio for a block of text beginning with the sentence in 1. 82. In other
manuscripts it is omitted. This is another short passage the origin of which
it is not easy to determine, but the fact that it is found in manuscripts
representing so many different groups makes it seem very probable that it has
come from Bracton.

F. 4221), ll. 32-39. Minor ctiam. . . . Lungesper. Marginal in LA.
MC has as a red iul( rubric and also as apart of the text; ME is similar to MC
in this, but omits the reference to W. Lungesper. OA, OB, MA, ΜΒ, CF,
CC, MN, all have the passage regularly with the exception of the reference to
W. Lungesper. This passage has certainly come from Bracton, but the
reference to W. Lungesper must be rejected.

F. 4261),11. 12-16. Funestam. . . personis. Inserted after aalma, 1. 4,
in MC. Marginal in LA. Omitted in OA, OB, MA, ΜΒ, MD, ΜΕ, CC,
CE, CM, Y. Not from Bracton.

F. 428, ll. 18-19. All between the two personarum is omitted by OA,
MA, MD, CC, CE3 but as the passage is contained in OB, ΜΒ, Mc, MN,
Y, it is evident that there is here no additio, but an omission due to similar
words in adjacent lines

F. 430, ll. 17-20. Ut prodatur. . . . acore aaa. This passage, which
contains references to two caseS, the first not in the Note Boolc, the second
being No. 1919, is found in the main text at the same point as in V, or after
commoni, l. 30, or after respondere, l. 21, in OA, OB, OD, OC (marks
additional), OE, MA, ΜΒ, MC, ΜΒ, ΜΗ, ΜΝ, CC, CB, CM. Ι1 is
therefore an addition made by Bracton himself.

F. 430, ll. tta-37. Et qaod. . .. russea A reference to a case not in
the Note Boolc. Regular in OB, MA, ΜΒ, MD, MN, Y. Inserted after
tereretur, 1. 25, in MC; aftersalatem, l. 26, in LA. Omitted in OA, OC, CC,
CF, CM, ME. As this addicto is found in the text of both (Ι) and (ΙΙΙ), it is
altogether probable that the passage comes from Bracton.

F. taob, ll. 5-14. Siaatem dubitetur. . . . hereditates. OB, MA, ΜΒ,
MD, MN, Y, have regularly. Inserted after mortui, l. 41, f. 430, in LA,
MH, ME, CM; after notabantur, 1. 48, f. 430, in MC; after omnes, l. 41,
tason in OA, OB, CC. Omitted in CF, OC. The case cited is not in the
Note Book. That this is one of Bracton’s own additions there can be no
doubt.
