PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

Il. Abbreviations formed of letters osten made to look alike. Because
of the similarity oft and c, a and u, cu, to, to (each with a dash over the last
letter-cri, tri, tr‘a), which rightly read cum, tum, torreo, are continually
interchanged. For the same reason the ca and ta (cci, tc) of caasa and tam are
osten misinterprcted. The abbreviation for breve is bre and that of tabere is
bre (each of the shortened forms having a dash over it), but because of the
similarity of b andlr as these letters are frequently made, the two words not
seldom were mistaken one for another by the scribes. Another letter some-
times made to look like b is one form of a (or v) which has a long first stroke; for
this reason the abbreviated bn of bene and the un of unm are quite osten mis·
read.¹ An and ou (with the single dash above), for unte and autem, also suffer
at the hands of the copyists.² Osten there is nothing to distinguish an m from
iu, both being made by three vertical strokes which may be correctly or incor-
rectly connected, or not connected at all. So mr (for muter) becomes confused
with iar (iuris or iure).⁸ Navi and uti are forever in dispute because of the
similarity of land ξ, Rom and roni (with the dash above each) are identical
in some manuscripts, so that ratioraem and rationi change places. Ptin, with
a straight line through the lower part of the p and amark over the n, for
pertinentiis, nine times out of ten looks exactly like pria (with the same marks),
for partium. Alii is mistaken for alo (the n with a dash over it), the abbrevi-
ation for adquorrdn and vice versa⁴ Alit (with an er sign over the t) and
alic (with an i placed over the c) are so much alike when made by one of the
less carcful of the scribes that aliter and alicui may readily become variants one
of another.⁶ Likewise the abbreviations for paruam and per unum will osten
be identical ;⁰ so also those of cum and eum. Fr and sr (each with the same simple
abbreviation sign) look much alike in the best of hands, consequently frater

and super are easily mistaken for one another. When la' is made to look like
Ιι, the abbreviation for licet (11) is identical with that for babet (Ιι). G with i
over it is igitur, with o above, ergo (j, 3);⁷ carelessly made i’s and o’s in this
position show a remarkable similarity of appearance. Even more readily does
