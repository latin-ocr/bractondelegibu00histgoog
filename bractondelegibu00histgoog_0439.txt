 

THE ADDICIONES

It is these aspects of the situation which make the facts pertaining to any
scheme of omission or insertion of any block of macinas by any combination
of manuscripts so inadequate for the purpose of determining the authorship or
value of those additiones, either separately or together. If that portion of the
text which has not yet been discussed were to be treated in the same way as
fs. raab, 45-151, 152-183-198, the same general sort of conditions would be
found to exist. Here, as everywhere else in connection with the additional
passages, there are numerous and constantly recurring contradictions. Taken
as a whole, the addicimus when studied in detail bear out the evidence, which
comes from many other sources, that even the earliest extant manuscripts are
many removes from the original, and that every line has been affected to a
greater or less degree by the results of a comparison with manuscripts in one
or more other lines.

The details of relationship worked out for one portion of the treatise may
not always be applied to other portions. Thus, as contradicting, or at least
limiting‚ the evidence in regard to LA’s marginalia on f. loob, there may be
cited the passage on f. 50b. This is important also because of the bearing it
has upon the value of omissions in LA and OA. The text in V is incorrect
because of an omission due to some scribe having lost his place in a repetition
of similar words. It should read (ll. 7-12) ..... de quibasdam imas, et qai
dicaam quod ric apud Line. Et qui dicerunt quod predictas Rogeras . . . .
domiuo rege aprrd Line ..... Now just as V has jumped from one et qui
dicerunt quod to the other, OA and LA have jumped from one aprrd Line. to
the other, reading, et qai damant quod ric apud Line. This is rather an
agreement between these two manuscripts as regards the text than as to the
addicionea In more than one place earlier in this volume it has been pointed
out that especially as regards structure, the leaving of space, and the beginning
of new quires, there is so much similarity as to make evident some connection
between certain parts of OA and LA. Just what the connection is the work
thus far done has not made clear. For the passages collated, LA shows a
closer textual relationship with MC than with OA, but it is not at all unlikely
that when the manuscripts are collated entire, the Digby manuscript and the
Lambeth manuscript for other portions of the text will reveal a much closer
relationship. Moreover, it must not be forgotten that OA and LA bave
shown an agreement in variant readings for some of their addicimus, as was
the ease with the passages on fs. 114, 114b, leth, 133. But it is not necessary
to proceed longer on this line. The bringing together of more facts of this
