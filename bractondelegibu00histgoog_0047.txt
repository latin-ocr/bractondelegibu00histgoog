PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

This subject of recopying can not be dismissed without a reference to the
correcting hands in the Bracton manuscripts. The ease with which cor·
rections in one text are absorbed into another makes them important in any
set of manuscripts. But our case is not comparable to that of correcting
hands in manuscripts of classical texts. In the early copies of the De Legibus
the corrector is very seldom concerned with the question of making an incor-

rect text sound. The changes are made by men who are interested not in
grammar or syntax but in practical law. It is not a scribe or grammarian who
alters the text, but a working lawyer, who does it for his own convenience, in
order to make the passage before him more clear to himself, to correct what
he considers wrong law, or to modernize a rather obsolete statement. And
often he does this in no sparing way. Then this corrector may not only alter
and delete, but may even make additions of his own, sometimes very extensive
ones, as we shall see. At times, too, he uses the margins of his manuscript
as space in which to write down legal matter, and osten other matter,
in no way relating to that part of the text opposite which it stands.
Several sets of these corrections and additions extending over a number of
generations may be found in some volumes, but as touching the matter of
pedigree the problem is simplified by the fact that as none of our extant
manuscripts comes from a later date than 1400, the question of sixteenth and
seventeenth century corrections can have no important bearing.

It would simplify our work of making a pedigree if at the beginning, by
some easily noted differences, we could classify the manuscripts in certain well·
defined groups. But here again we come face to face with a very unusual
situation. In probably no other set of manuscripts, ancient or medieval, is
there such a diversity of external form independent of differences in the text.
Anything more than a cursory examination will show that these thirteenth
and fourteenth centmy copies of Bracton’s book differ among themselves in
three broad lines of divergence, namely, in regard to the points of division in
the treatise, the order of subjecta, and the treatment of the addiciones. That
much is plainly evident. But when we attempt to go further, and on the
basis of these differences build up groups in which the differentiation is distinct
enough to make them at the same time inclusive and exclusive, we find a
definite classification impossible. Some sort of information these sets of dif-
ferences do give us, but it is of the broadest and most general kind, and of
little determining value unless aided by the far more precise evidence derived
from collation.
