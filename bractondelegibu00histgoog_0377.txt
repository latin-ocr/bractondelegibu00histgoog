PEDlGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

For any of the passages the number of variants is large. By far the
larger portion of them are due to irregularities which concern at most only a
few manuscripts at any one place. Many of them are found in only a single
text. Usually there is no doubt as to what the correct reading should be.
Thus when CF and LT give qao, and MA, ME, CD, CM, X, have oeqaoli,
we do not have to wonder if the reading of the other manuscripts, oeqoo, is
correct. Yet it should be kept in mind that the mere fact that a majority of
the manuscripts have a certain reading does not necessarily make that reading
correct. The poor texts far outnumber the good, and if numbers alone were
to count as authority the worse reading would often prevail. It is easy to
eliminate the variant of the single manuscript, or the variant common to a
soattering few. But when the case is one in which whole groups of texts
folloW, more or less consistently, each a different reading, it is another matter.
So when the manuscripts are fairly evenly divided between hahere and cohibere
or aa& and acm (see groupings for fs. 38b35) it becomes necessary to discover
the weight of authority on which either reading rests. The important thing
is to get the different traditions; the exceptional or individual variant very
seldom counts.

Ol the three large groups into which we have divided the manuscripts (Ι)
, is the most distinctive, with (ΙΙΙ) next, and (ΙΙ) least distinctive of all. The
earliest extant manuscripts are in (Ι) and (ΙΙΙ). Throughout (ΙΙ) is closer to
(ΙΙΙ) than to (Ι). (ΙΙ) is the group in which the greatest number of
additiones are found, with (ΙΙΙ) coming next iu this respect, and (Ι) last. As
a group, (ΙΙ) is inferior to either (Ι) or (ΙΙΙ); but as the traditions peculiar to
each group developed at an early period, (ΙΙ) has to be considered along with
(Ι) and (III). Theoretically, enough manuscripts should be used to stop
every line of descent, so to speak. Thus m the following figrue
