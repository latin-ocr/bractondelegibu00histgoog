BRACI'ON: DE LEGIBUS

non-extant (a), while s, t, u, v, o, would be compmed to assertam the
probable text of the no longer existing (1). But because 01 the gaps, the
broken lines 01 descent, and the interweaving and crossing of lines in the
pedigree, such a selection in the case of the Bracton manuscripts would
involve practicslly every one of the forty-odd copies. And the use of so
many originale inthe formation of a new text would be inexpedient Nor is
it requisite. The only necessity is to use the codices in such a way ss to
discover every real difference 01 text reading among those groups which
represent a different direct tradition.

No one tradition may be taken as the correct text. Each tradition must
be gauged and weighed by the others. If the readings of any one line or
group are even generally accepted as correct, it means that there will bea
comparatively large number of variants in all the members 01 other lines or
groups. One of the reasons why (ΙΙΙ) shows up so well in the collation
above is that the basis of the text was taken from manuscripts in that group
rather than from members 0111) or (11). For every passage collated, the fact
stands out that no one line or any single manuscript gives consistently
Braeton’s own words.

There is osten a real question as to just what Bracton wrote. A detailed
study of his entire book might possibly show that he had predilections for
certain words or forms of expression; it might be found that he used the
indicative in preference to the subjunctive, or had a tendeney to write a
present form where the future might be expected. But such information is
not yet available. Even if it were it would not ensure a decision in all cases
of contradiction. Itis not always a question of the best word, or even of the
right word. Time and again the manuscripts are divided between words,
sometimes of practically the same meaning, either one of which would make
sense. How shall we know, for instance, whether the original draft of the
De Legibus had recuperandum or reparandum in the passage on f. 511
What is to guide usin our choice of words at such a place? Did Bracton
write voce or vom⁸ in l. 4 off. 3201 The simplici will not tell us, neither will
the rest 01 the clause. In 1. 21, f. 4131, did he use fit or fiat? And at the
beginning of the very next sentence is the esus temporal or concessive? To
be correct shotdd the text read com. . . . conpetant or cum . . . . cmsmtsnt?
Some ten lines above this possunt would go better than the usual poterunt.
Did Brscton write itl The eight manuscripts which have possunt are from
several different lines, and by no means the best. How shall we explain the
