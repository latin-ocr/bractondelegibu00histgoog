PEDIGREE 01⁴* THE MANUSCBIPTS

· Glancing again at the rubric with which ΟΕ begins its second book we
notice that it makes a reference to the treatises (Expedite tractatibus) contained
in the first section of the work. Quite evidently in OE’s family it was con·
sidered that the first book of the De Legibus was subdivided into parts.
Those parts were apparently three (the commas are ourS, as there are no
marks of punctuation in the original), namely, dc iure personarum et reram
divisim dc distinctione cartarum, and de obligationibus et actionibus. The
first division agrees with book one of V; the second is a single chapter, the
sixteenth of V’s second book; the third is the subject of Actions. Having
thus referred to the first book, in retrospect as it were, OE enumerates some
of the matters to be found in the second. It does not call it a liber, but a
tractatus. That it means liber in this connection there can be no doubt.
After dividing the first book into at least three treatises, OE could not well
speak of something coming after as the second treatise. Moreover OB, which
makes the same divisions and has about the same rubric, calls it a liber. The
word is used more than once again in these mbricS, by OB at the beginning
of the fourth book to denote a treatise-dc tractatu saper brevi de recto-and
twice in OE at book five to designate a liher-quorto tractata and quinto
tractat . According to these rubrics, then, tractatus may mean either one of
the books into which the De Legibus may be divided‚ or a subdivision of
’ one of those books. How does Bracton himself use the word in connection
with the work he is writingf On f. lb it is to be met with twice, “in hoc
autem tractatu, sicut in aliis tractatibus‚” and “et de hiis habere tractatum. ’⁹
In both these places the context shows that he is thinking of his whole work
when he writes tractans. But he uses the word in other senses also. Near
the end off. 21 we read, “secundum quod inferius dicetur in tractatu de
dote.” On f. 39 he speaks of the treatise of Novel Disseisin.¹ On f. esth,
at the very begirming of the Writ of Right, he uses it twice, each time ina
different sense, once in a collective way, as liber, to include the several
treatises on the possessory assises, and again to denote the single treatise on
Entry.⁹ In any one of these last three cases the word refers to a portion of
the work, and not to the whole work, in this respect being used with the
same meaning as in OB and OE. ln other words, Bracton definitely thought
of his book as being composed of certain treatises.

¹ See also f. eleb, “secundum quod superius dicitur in tractatu de disseisinis’'; end sect. 8, f. 829 b.
“De commonitionibus . . . . nolo inserere huic tractatui propter diversas consuetudines . . . .”

’ Worthy of notice in this connection is a passage on f. 265, ⁴⁴. . . . pertinet ad tractatum de bastardia, ut
infre dicetur plenius, ubi apponitur bastardia iu modum exceptionis.”
