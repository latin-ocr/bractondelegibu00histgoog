PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

produced by comparison rather than by recopying. It has been noticed that
many of the codices which show the influence of OA’s quire scheme in their
altered order have been derived from more than a single copy, primarily or
otherwise. We have abundant proof from the manuscripts themselves that
some of the scribes worked with at least two models at hand.l It is quite
conceivable that a copyist working with two exemplans as his guida, and
finding fs, aab-98 lacking in one of them at the regular place and inserted near
the end of the treatise, might put it near the end in his book, though copying
it from the model which had it in the earlier and correct position. But what-
ever a collation of these special parts of the text might show,² it is not
necessary in order to prove the important point in this connection. From the
facts which have been brought forward we can be sure that the peculiar quire
arrangement of OA is responsible, either directly or indirectly, for the irregu-
larities of the other manuscripts. Likewise we can be sure that in its quire
arrangement ΟΑ is not reproducing the special features of an original De
Legibus. Therefore‚ the several manuscripts which transpose or omit certain
blocks of text are perpetuating divisions found first not in Bracton’s own copy
of his book, but in ΟΑ. That there exists a connection of some sort between
these manuscripts and ΟΑ is evident. What the connection is, the irregu-
larities of order do not tell; in the making of a pedigree they offer no direct

help, nor are the problems which they bring up entirely solved when the
pedigree is established.

We now come to the question as to whether or not there are any data
furnished by the addicimus which might make possible the speedy determination
of the lines of descent. As the whole subject of additions to the text is to be

,¹ A very interesting example of this ia aean in the case of MD in the collatiou given below for fs. 413-
alab. For the most part MD agrees very closely with MA and MA'a line. In regard toapaasege on f. 414,
“Ut si uuus petat per unum. . . . de Ricardo filio Godelridi‚” there is a lack of agreement among the
manuscripta, which results in the passage being found in some MSS. at one point aud in other MSS. at
another point. MDhas itin both places, agreciug with MA iu its variants when the position of the passage
corresponds to lts position in MA, and agreeing with the other set of MSS„ against MA, when the passage
occurs in the otherplace. Compare also the agreement of MA and MD, MD and OC, in the collatlon of
le. lul-loab. See p. Mabove.

¹ As a result of the omissione (noted above) and the constantly recurriug gupa in the lines ol desecat, lt
is doubtful if a collatiou would give much definite assistance toward a solution of the problem.
