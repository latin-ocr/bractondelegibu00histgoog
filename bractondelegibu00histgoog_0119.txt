PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

astemoon or early evening before candles were lighted, they must have worked
at their copying irr the half gloom in which we of a later age are sometimes
forced to read what they have written. Even under the best of conditions the
light iu a medieval room must have been subdued, to say the least; and the
flickering light of a candle has ever played tricks on the eyes. The very
circumstances under which the scribe had to work would often conspire to make
many mistakes easy, and some practically unavoidable. The abbreviations,
of which more will be said shortly, would be especially affected by this matter ·
of a poor light; but its influence would be felt in every detail of copying, as
tending to increase the number of misreadings and mistakes which were bound
to result, apparently, under even the most favorable conditions. One mistake
in particular which can be explained most naturally on the assumption that
the scribe was working in a dim light is the misreading of such words as
recedat, eradiat, for recedit, amittit, the curved part of the a-written light,
perhaps, or somewhat hidden by the last stroke of the preceding letter—being
unnoticed by the scribe, who saw only the vertical stroke which he read for an
i. Some letters, or combinations of letters, were so often written to look
alike that the context alone would enable the copyist to determine their
individuality. If he were careless, or either unwilling or unable to understand
what he was writing, his mistakes along this line, especially when poor light
added to his difficulties were such as might be expected. The letters particu-
larly affected—as usual, the abbreviations suffered most—were (n, u, ii;
m, in, ni, vi, iul, (b, u, v), (b, h), (c, t), (c, e), (f, s).¹ Such words as
moneat-moveat, noluerit—voluerit, ius—uis, fait-sint, sit—ssc-fit, were
frequently interchanged.

A very common cause of non-detenninative variants was the mistake often
made by the scribes of confusing a word or phrase in one place with the same
word or phrase in another place a little further on. There is probably no one
of the present time who has done any appreciable amount of copying from

medieval manuscripts but has been guilty at times of the same mistake, intent

¹ The nse oi the short dash above the line to represent m or a often led to mistakes in copying, especially
if it was immediately preceded or followedby letters made from simple vertical strokes as i, a, m, ss, etc„ the
scribe sometimes placing the dash over the wrong letter. Very clearly, also, the dasbes were now and then
omittetis or the actual letter m (or a) might be substituted for the dash, which by some other copyist might be
need in place of the letter that it was meant to represent. An interesting example of bow a word might be
changed by this process is to be seen ou f. losb, l. d, at which place the printed text reads mmiaots' for a
clearly required iooonsiooti (“ . . . . we should hardly do wrong in reading innominati instead oi minati,
