PEDIGBEE OF THB MANUSCRIPTS

better than the reading of his own, which was accordingly corrected. Then
M was loaned that MA might be copied from it. This would account
for the fact that MA, though in the larger OB group, agrees in places with
OC’s group against OB. Sometime after MA had been made, Μ was again
used as an exemplar, this time for MD. But in the meanwhile the owner of
M had corrected his manuscript in several more places, so that it agreed more
closely with the OC tradition. Hence MD agrees with OC in many places
where MA agrees with the OB line. We are almost, if not quite, justified in
going a step further and saying that at least in the latter part of his work the
scribe of MD had before him both M and the codex by which M had been
corrected. Such is certainly the indication of the duplicated passages in MD
on fs. lla-alst, where MD faithfully follows both M and OC in spite of the
very noticeable contradictions in both the position and the actual reading of
the repeated passages. The same sort of contradictions as those existing
between MA and MD are found in many other instances, but never so easily
explained. Yet the principle on which the connection must be worked out is
the same. And if it is not always possible to see just what has happened, we
are better able to hit upon probahilities through understauding what might
have happened. For many of the manuscripts inform us on this last point.
Any one who glauces at the multiplicity of corrections in CB realizes at once
how diffieuh it would be to determine the relationship of a copy made from
CB, supposing the corrections to have been made a regular part of the text,
and CB itself to have been lost. In every instance where a text which agrees
generally with one line agrees also occasionally with another line, there is
always the suspicion-unless the case is one which depends upon a non·
determinative variant—that the exemplar has been corrected. In making out
the pedigree it should be kept in mind that because of such corrections, two
manuscripts which are in reality very close to a common ancestor may have
many points of difference.

On the other hand, an exceptionally close agreement between two texts
does not prove that one was copied from the other. More than once in the
collated passages a pair of manuscripts will agree in every essential so closely
and for so long a time that the tendency to regard one as the offspring of the
other becomes almost irresistible. Such differences of reading as exist can
very often be explained on the basis of the scribe having misread his exemplar;
mere differences of reading, therefore, frunish no means of checking up this
relationship. Omission is the only real check. It will be noticed that in the
