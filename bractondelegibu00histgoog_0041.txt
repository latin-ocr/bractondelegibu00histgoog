PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

Guwnnnn Fuxruaus or rna Manuscrurrs

If arguments were needed to prove the necessity of making a pedigree
of the extant manuscripts of the treatise as the first step in the editing of a
new text of Bracton, the three editions of his book which have been printed
would fumish an abundance. In no spirit of cavilling we may say that the
printed text of this work has been so far below the standard largely because
the editors in their choice of manuscripts have shown little power of discnmi-
nation, and even less knowledge of the relationship of the different codices.
Such knowledge could have come only as the result of a detailed study and
comparison of all the manuscripts, and this, apparently, they did not under·
take. Consequently it has come about that the main object of this volume is
to establish a pedigree which will clear up once and for all the question of
the relation of the many Bracton manuscripts to one another, and show their
relative value for purposes of text production. The need of this is so apparent,
and the doing of it so fimdamentally necessary as a preparation for a correct
text, that the time and space which bave been devoted to the task can in no
way be considered wasted.

For the present we are not considering the question of the correct text
of any particular portion of Bracton’s treatise. The work of making a pedigree
of any set of manuscripts is quite different from that of ascertaining the correct
text of the piece of writing which they represent. While for purposes of
text criticism the manuscripts vary in value, one is just as important as
another when we are determining the'place which each must occupy in the
family tree. A very little study would suffice to show that some of the

Bracton manuscripts are practically worthless from a textual standpoint, and
yet these same manuscripts must be subjected to just as close a semtiny as
the best of their kind when the matter of pedigree is under consideration.
Indeed, it is upon the poorer class of manuscripts, the corrupt texts of which
furnish a larger number of variants, that the greater amount of time and work
