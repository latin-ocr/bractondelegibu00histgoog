BRACI'ON: DE LEGIBUS

series of variants which OD, PH, and the other manuscripts in (ΙΙΙ) do not
have. Nor do these manuscripts in (ΙΙΙ), one or all, show any affiliation with
any of the subgroups of (ΙΙ). This holds true in spite of the fact that MC
agrees as to the position of the addicto with some ol the members of (II),
which in this respect go contrary to OC. Seemingly the tradition of (ΙΙΙ) ia
not the same as that of (ΙΙ) lor this addicio. The most noticeable point of
difference is where the five manuscripts of (ΙΙΙ), OD and PH included, agree
on filias for the regular filios of (ΙΙ). Therefore, this addicio, unlike the three
first considered, is backed up by the tradition of both (ΙΙ) and (ΙΙΙ) instead of
by the former only. The inevitable question is as to whether or not some
common ancestor of the manuscripts in (III) took this passage from a common
ancestor of the manuscripts in (ΙΙ). Though such a borrowing might be
possible, theoretically at least, there is nothing in the manuscripts themselves
to suggest it. For the addiciones on fs. 32b35 it was plainly to be seen that
manuscripts in (ΙΙΙ) and (Ι) had taken over the additional matter from (ΙΙ).
Here no such borrowing is at all evident on the part of any member of (Ill),
though for (Ι) ΜΙ) continues to show the same close relationship with OC.
The more the collation is studied the stronger grows the impression that at
this place (ΙΙΙ) and (ΙΙ) represent totally different traditions for the addicia
We are practically forced to the conclusion that the common ancestor of (ΙΙΙ)
and the common ancestor of (ΙΙ) both had this addicio. And when we get
back that far we are not very distant from the manuscript which was Bracton’s
own. There is thus every indication that in giving this addicio both (ΙΙΙ) and
(ΙΙ) are reproducing something which was in the original manuscript.

An addicio which is clearly from Bracton is that found in the collated ⁵

passage on f. 161b. Itis given in all but two of the forty manuscripts which
have been examined, and is particularly interesting in this discussion as showing
the way in which the manuscripts may treat an additio from the author’s own
hand. Groups (Ι), (ΙΙ), (ΙΙΙ), are all represented. Each one of the main
groups is further divided by the variants for the passage into sub-groups,
which with possibly one exception are the same as those already derived for
the text proper. In both text and adda'cio we get the sub-groups (OB, LF,
LG), (Ml, LC, CM), (MA, MD), (ME, MH, LB, CC), (CA, X), (OF, MG),
(ΟΜ, HA, W), (OC, MD), (OG, Y), (CF, LT), (MC, LA), the last standing
out more strongly in the addicto than in the main text. In the addicioncs on
fs. aab-35, which belonged exclusively to group (ΙΙ), sub-groups appeared for
that main group only, although the other main groups were not lacking in
