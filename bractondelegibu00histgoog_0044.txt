BRACI'ON: DE LEGIBUS

easily understood because written in the lawyers’ own French-English
lawyers of the second and third generation aster Bracton should have gone to
the trouble of making these condensed copies of his work. Some parts of his
book, apparently, they were willing to omit; other parts just as clearly, they
were not well content to do without.

Of some writings, both classical and medieval, the number of extant
manuscripts is so great as to form an almost unwieldy mass of material. The
manuscripts of the De Legibus, though unusually plentiful when the size of
the work and the short period of time during which they were produced are
considered, are not so numerous as to make difficult the working out ofa
pedigree. Practically all of them come from the century aster Bracton, many
of them falling within a shorter hmit of fisty years, and very few being written
after 1350. Many of the classieal authors have been preserved forus in sets
of manuscripts which stretch over centuries‚ those of one age differentiated
from those of another by certain distinguishing peculiarities which are of great
assistance in solving many problema especially in connection with the lines of
descent. But here we have a set of manuscripts which, though multiplied
sufficiently‚ are so limited in point of time as, with the exceptiones the very
earliest and the very latest, to be lacking in¹ distinct age characteristica In
compensation for this we might expect that among so many manuscripts
coming so soon after the death of an author at no great distance in the past,
there would be preserved one which was very close to the original. Unfortu·
nately, this is not the ease. No one of the extant manuscripts is nearer than
the third generation to the original, at the nearest; the majority fall in
generations much further on. There is hardly a manuscript whose immediate
ancestry has not disappeared. Numerous gaps in every line, from the
beginning on, prove that the half a hundred copies now existing are only part
of the number actually written. These gaps in the line of descent have more
than overbalanced the advantage of a not too large number of manuscripts.

More serious even than this loss of intermediate manuscripts is the
difficulty occasioned by what was the practice of some scribes of using more
than one copy as an exemplar. Even among the earlier manuscripts we get
evidence to show that the scribe either had at least two models before him, 'or
that he was copying from one which had been derived from more than one
source. This does not apply to all the manuscripts, but to a number large
enough to deserve notice. Over and over again we come upon variants, usually
connected by alios, inserted in the text. A very good example of this is found
