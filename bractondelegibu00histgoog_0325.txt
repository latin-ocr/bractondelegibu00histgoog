PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

corrections having been made and copied. In two instances X agrees
decisively with MK, this again being due apparently to a correction having
been made in some exemplar, as X does not show any affiliation with the
larger group of ten manuscripts which contain MK. The appearance of ML
proves that great care was taken in the selection of parchment and the actual
copying of the book3 the fact that at both this and other places it agrees with
more than one of the groups—for the most part it is found in agreement with
either (ΙΙΙ) or (ΙΙ), or both—and the fact that its own peculiar variant readings
are just double the number it has in common with one or another of the other
manuscripts, would indicate that care had been exercised in more than the
mere mechanical side of its composition, and that different texts had been
compared—at least in places-for a cboice of readings. OC is seen to agree
at times with (Ι) and (ΙΙΙ) against its own group (ΙΙ). It does not come into
close association with any other member of (ΙΙ), except that its most decided
point of agreement and disagreement is where it reads ubi desputatio for
dubitatio, agreeing here with OG against all others. There isnot‚ however,
that noticeable agreement between OC and the first part of OG which we
find in other of th'e collated passages. More than once one fails to follow the
leading of the other. Yet they are most certainly related. Each has what is
perhaps the most distinctive reading of (Ill-sint cannones aut for communes
sint—and with (Ι) and most of (ΙΙΙ) they have tabere where the other
manuscripts read eoelribere.

The members of (ΙΙΙ) at times follow the traditions of (Ι) and (ΙΙ). OA,

' ΟΕ, MC, LA, agree with (Ι) in reading tabere for cohibere. OA and ΟΕ

follow (Ι) with am andsaer’at for nom andfatact, in the first of these readings
MC and LA disagreeing with all others and having sed. OA again agrees
with (Ι) against (ΙΙ) and the rest of (III) in having positum for appositum, but
on the other hand it agrees with (ΙΙ) against (Ι) by reading privatorum for
parata. MC and LA three times agree with the larger group (Ill-potest,
faciet, appositum-and three times agree together against all others though
they do not always coincide in their readings ΟΕ does not always go with
OA. OD goes contrary to the rest of (ΙΙΙ) by following (ΙΙ) in reading
cohibere. OD is four times found in agreement with (ΙΙ), each time contrary
to OA, three times contrary to CE, twice to MC, and once to LA. In having
ut for quod it agrees with OA, ΟΕ, LA, and two representatives each from

groups (Ι) and (ΙΙ). OA and ΟΕ lean rather towards (Ι), while MC, LA,
OD, are more closely connected with (ΙΙ). As a group, the manuscripts in
