PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

taken more directly from a near relative of ΜΕ. But the acceptance of that
suggestion would necessitate the difficult explanation of why P and ΜΕ have
quos where MF has quod, and voco where ΜΕ has vocabo vocabo for the usual
vocabo. ΜΕ, together with ME, Ρ, OG, MD, has solicet deum where OD
and the other manuscripts have Mum scilicet. This latter variant, however, is
non-determinative. OD, ΜΕ, MF, P, ΟΟ, OG, MD, are brought together
by their use of Factum for Item foetam. Such changes as require a different
representation from that already given for the addicio on f. 33 concern these
manuscripts only. They may be shown thus:

FOLIOS 161-162b

For this passage thirty-nine manuscripts have been collated. As in the
passage on fs. 33th the larger groups may be denoted by (Ι), (ΙΙ), (ΙΙΙ),

-- with the arrangement as follows: (I) OB, OM, MA, ΜΒ, MD, ΜΙ, CM,

LC, LF, LG, HA, W; (ΙΙ) ΟΟ, OF, OG, ΜΕ, ΜΟ, ΜΗ, MK, CA, CB,
CC, CF, CH, LB, LD, LE, LT, ΗΒ, Χ; (ΙΙΙ) OA, ΟΕ, ΜΟ, LA, OD,
ML, MF, Ρ, Υ. (Ι) breaks up into (OB, LF, LG), (OM, MA, ΜΒ, MD,
ΜΙ, CM, LC, HA, W), (MA, ΜΒ, MD, ΜΙ, ΟΜ, LC), (OM, HA, W),
(MA, MD), (ΜΙ, CM, LC), (ΟΜ, HA), with MD again showing the
influence of corrections from another line in its exemplar. (II) contains the
smaller groups (OF, ΜΕ, ΜΟ, ΜΗ, MK, CB, ΟΟ, LB, ΗΒ), (ΜΕ, ΜΗ,
ΟΟ, LB), (OF, MG), (CB, ΗΒ), (CA, X), (CF, ΕΤ), (ΟΟ, OG—first part).

(ΙΙΙ) does not so decisively split up into such well-defined groups, but we get
these combinations, (MC, MF, LA, P, Y), (MC, LA), (LA, Y), (ΜΕ, Ρ),
(OA, ΟΕ), (Y, OG-second part).

While most of the subgroups in (I) stand apart quite clearly, there is
some little question regarding the possible connection of MD with the group
OM, HA, W. By referring to the arrangement of the manuscripts by groups
