From the arrangement by groups, which gives the larger outlines of
relationship in a general way, we come naturally to the more specific and
graphio delineation of the lines of descent. It might seem from what has
preceded that the drawing of a number of lines in their proper positions and
places to represent the connection existing between the manuscripts would be
· a comparatively easy matter. But the task is far from being a simple one,
even in its broader features, and is quite impossible for some of the details.

In the first place-and this point bas been mentioned before-there isa
decided lack of continuity of relatiouship among the manuscripts which are yet
in existence. We have neither the original copy nor any of its descendants in
the first generatim, Our oldest manuscripts are not better than grand·
children, or possibly great-grandchildren, of the original. This means that
instead of tracing back one line or two lines to a common ancestor we are
compelled to work back along several lines to as many different heads of
faurilies each occupying about the same relative position in regard to the
original, and each, therefore, of about equal importauce and authority. At
many of the steps in this process we come upon gaps in the line of desceut.
· So it happens that while the general family relationship of any manuscript is
usually quite easily determined the closer connection of one copy with
another is at times hard to decide. Because of the loss of some one of the
connecting links we often are unable to tell whether two manuscripts stand
in the relative position of cousins, or of uncle and nephew, or of grandfather
and grandson. What, for instance, shall be said of the exact relatiouship of
ΜΒ, ΜΙ, ΜΝ, as shown by the collation of fs. lla-llsb? Or in just what
way are CB, B, related to the other members of the larger OF group at the
