BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

The following figure is meant to show at a glauce the approximately
relative positions of the Brocton manuscripts in regard to a common center.
Ina way it is a combination of the many figures which have already been
drawn, yet it should be kept in mind that because of the differences between
the collated passages it will not altogether fit any one of them. of necessity
much about it is arbitrnry. But it shows ns well ns any scheme could in such
alnck of details the mein points brought out by the collation.
