THE ADDICIONES

of manuscripts which he may have made did not have behind it the motive of
discovering variant readings. He was not really intent on improving the text.
Apparently his one object was to incorporate into his book everything which

might have any possible claim of having been written by Bracton. And that
part of his work was overdone; he brought in an exeessive amount of extrane-
ous matter which had no rightfrd place in the treatise. Yet it would be unfair
. to accuse him of having inserted everything for which manuscript authority
could be found. Though the all too frequent repetition of passages shows
that he did not always exercise due care, and though there are included in his
text passages which are found in none, or in only a few, of the extant manu·
scripta, yet the absence of certain other passages-found osten enough in the
general run of manuscripts to make their discovery practieally certain by any
one who might be looking for such material—suggests at least the probability
of his having made some sort of comparison and selection. Even such a thing
as the insertion of the case of John de Metingham (f. 26) does not eonviet him
of having shown no discrimination. This particular case is found in no one of
the extant manuscripts; later researeh has proven it to be a case tried eight
years aster Bracton’s death; but there is nothing in the reference itself by
which the first editor could be expected to have known that some one other
than Bracton had first written it. When all is said, however, the fact remains
that there is far more in the present printed text than any future editor will
ever be willing to include in a new De Legibus. Mueh must be eut out and
thrown away. In order that the pruning may be done wisely, the whole
subject of the additional passages must be earefully gone over, and then each
micio considered individually to determine its right, or lack of right, to a
place in Bracton's book.

At the very beginning we ean get rid of the repetitions in the printed
text. More than once in V the same passage occurs in two different plasea.
Thus the long Ut si quis maioma fecerit . . . . Si autem maior tuac relevium
passage is found on f. 33 and again on f. Bab. Near the beginning and again
near the end of f. 196 we have· the same six lines, Et maa (torma) omos
nmen. . . . sicut in persono (loanni. On f. abab is a repetition of another
type, whieh gives us identical words for the end of section six and the
beginning of section seven. A reference to a case from Β Henry III is twice
given within a space of ten lines on f. 820. A complete list of these repeated
passages is not necessary at this place. The collation of the text will reveal

them all. Most of them are manaucandum be found in the list of such
