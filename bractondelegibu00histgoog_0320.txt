BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

changes had occurred in OE and W, written respectively in eight and five
different hands, rather than in the uniformly written OM and HA. Yet even
these latter two change their relative positions. The actual facts can not be
determined by assumptions and possibilities; they have to be worked out on
the basis of a detailed collation. And along this line, the chief fact which the
collation already done makes evident‚ isthat there are comparatively few of
the manuscripts which do not show at some time or other an agreement with
different family lines.

To the complications in the lines of descent produced by this changing
about in so many of the manuscripts are added the difficulties resulting from
the copying of corrected texts. When amanuscript in one line was corrected
here and there to make its readings in places agree with those of another
manuscript in another line, and then copied, the text of the new copy would
agree consistently with neither line. Under certain conditions such correc-
tions may stand out in a way which helps to determine the grouping of the
manuscripts, as in the case of the X V aliua XVIII in the collated passage ou
f. 96, but more usually they tend to increase the work of straightening out
the tangled family lines. Perhaps the best illustration of the effect which ·
may be produced by this sort of copying in its various stages is to be found in
the case of the pair group MA, MD. The connection between these two
codices has aheady been referred to (p. 91, n. 1). Usually they will be found
in the larger OB group, always they maintain a close connection with one
another. A study of the collation will show that at times they both disagree
with the OB line, in which, without any doubt, they rightly belong. Osten
MD does not agree with MA, in many places giving a better reading than the
latter, and agreeing with another line. At first sight it might very well seem
that MD represents an earlier branch of the line along which MA has come,
one less distant from the original. But because OC happens to be preserved
for us it is possible to prove that MD has come along the same line as MA, the
two being at least as closely related as cousins It is altogether possible, not
to say probable, that they are brothers, with MA the elder„ For the circum-
stances seem to have been these: The codex from which MA was copied,
for convenience we will call it M, belonged to the larger OB group.
Before MA was written, M had been corrected at a few places of noticeable
differences of reading by a manuscript closely related to OC. We may
suppose, for instance, that the owner of M had access to a friend’s copy '
of the De Legibus, and for some places hked the reading of the latter
