PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIP‘IS

group. The handwriting in this manuscript has changed since the last collated
passage, and this may mean a change 01 line. Yet there is not shown that
preference for (IV) which is found on fs. 4134151). As shown above (p. 276),
ΜΕ, ΜΗ, CM, MM, CF, LT, Le, P, agree in their use 01 tradidit and
the omission of the addicio.

To make this discussion more complete, the matter 01 the changes in
handwriting should be considered. Though this subject at just this place
concerns group (IV) rather than other manuscripts it may bc well to show the
changes occurring in those which have been written by more than one scribe.
The numerals represent the different hands in the order in which they occur in
each coderr.

Α comparison of this table with the facts already brought out in regard 10
the relationship of the manuscripts in group (IV) shows at once that a change
of handwriting does not at all necessarily result in a change of line 01 descent.
The tradition may or may not change with the writing. On f. ab we have
LCl and on 1. 51), Le„ yet both belong in (Ι). On f. 413, Le, is in (IV); on
1. 331), Le, ’ goes into (ΙΙ), and 0111161 11 is found in (Ι). ΟΕ, which
though not itself in (IV) was seen to be connected at times with both LC and
W, shows the opposite characteristics, OE„ OE„ OE„ all being found in (Ι),
and even within the same sub-group (ΟΕ, ΜΙ, Le). No general rule which

will in any way apply to all cases can be laid down for the connection between
changes in hand and changes in tradition. Several scribes may have copied a
