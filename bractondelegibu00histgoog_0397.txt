THE ADDICIONES

11. De carisa regni iuratis ai noa observentur. CM omits in the
kalendar, and LA in the text. The other manuscripts are as V.

It would be easy to pick out places where such a comparison would show
greater differences than exist here between the manuscripts, and between the
manuscripts and V. But the comparison of these eleven rubrica gives typical
examples of the more usual differences in both kind and amount. In spite of
these differences the general agreement is rather marked; no difficulty is
experienced in deciding upon the proper rubrics for this portion of the text.

Yet some of the disagreements are noticeable. Only in ΜΒ do the
rubrica in both the table of contenta and the text consistently agree. OA,
LA, MA, CM, clearly could not have derived the rubrics in their texts from
the headings in their kalendars. Nor could the table of contents in any one
of these manuscripts have been made by merely copying down in order the
rubrics in the texts. In either case there are too many omissions on one side
and too many additions on the other to have made this possible. The scribe
who wrote the table of contents for CM apparently tried to make his entries
as brief as possible, with the result that they are regulme shorter than those
in the text. But in the other manuscripts considered the general similarity
shown by the two sets of rubrics leaves no doubt that the object of the writers
of each was to give in either place the full and correct form of the rubrio.
This makes the differences all the more significant. Even from these few
rubrica we get the suggestion thatin some instances the table of contenta
might have been copied from another source than that from which the text
had been taken. A more extended comparison proves this to have some·
times been the case3 that kalendar and text may represent different traditions
is apparent time and time again. It is not hard to account for this fact.
When a manuscript which had no table of contents was copied, its descendants
might easily be supplied with one from some other manuscript. 'How osten
this was done there is no means of knowing. Many of the manuscripts are
without a kalendar. Many, as has already been noticed, were copied from
more than a single exemplar. In manuscripts of this latter sort it is not likely
that the kalendar would represent more than one of the exemplars. Facta
already given amply prove that the presence or absence of a kalendar in the
head ofa family of manuscripts did not necessarily mean a continuation of the
same feature among all of its descendants. No two of the manuscripts show
throughout their text collation better evidence of a common ancestry than OF

and MG. One has a kalendar, the other has not. Which one of them
