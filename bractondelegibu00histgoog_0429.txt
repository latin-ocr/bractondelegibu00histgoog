THE ADDICIONES

changes which take place, they will be seen to occur quite independently of
any scheme of division connected with the different hands in OA.

But little better results are obtained by working along other lines. When
taken individually some of the manuscripts show distinctly different methods
of treating the addideras for different and well-defined portions of text. At
times, too, it is possible to arrange a scheme which for a certain amount of
text will apply toalimited combination of manuscripts. But even after this has
been done the significance of the result is not plain. No single manuscript has a
plan for the treatment or arrangement of the addicioaes which covers the whole
treatise. Even the best defined schemas take in only fragments of the
whole work. And there is not discoverable any continued connection between
the plan followed by one manuscript or group and that adopted by another.
For the three larger groups one of the facts made clear by the collation of the
twelve passages is emphasized here, that considering the treatise as a whole, (Ι)
usually omits the addiciones, (ΙΙ) usually gives them in the main text, while in
(ΙΙΙ) some of the manuscripts give and some omit. From the standpoint of
discovering any group policy for the treatment of additional matter, an
analysis of the individual manuscripts in (ΙΙΙ) is barren of results. Thus ΟΕ
has the madores in the text for what in V are fs. 15-151, alab-226, avebam,
arab-4193 it omits the same kind of passages on fs. 12-4ab,181-218,228-271,
283b-3703 on fs 152-180b, 422 to eud, the additiones are sometimes put in
the text and sometimes omitted. The method followed by OA has already
been discussed. LA has in the margin, with now and then a scattered
omission, the addamus which come on the following folios of the printed
text: lob-aab, aab-llab, 155b-192b, auo-219, alo-841, 885-412b3 they are
omitted on fs. larab, eth-86, aab-96, ΙΙΙ-152, 265-298; they are found in
the text on fs. 1961)-203-212, aar-3823 in other places they are found in the
text or in the margin or are omitted without any apparent regularity. MC
usually gives the adeliciam in the main text; they are now and then omitted,
notably on fs. 12-281), aab-84, 288b·298-in this latter block in every instance.
OD has even more of these passages in its text, its omissions or marginal
passages being merely occasional. For two or three rather small blocks of
text there is a general agreement in omissions between MC and LA. But for
the text as a whole these two manuscripts are far from agreeing as to either
the presence or absence of addicioaes. The collation already made of parts of
their main text and some few addicimus really tells us far more than any
information whioh can be gathered from the fact of their having or not having
