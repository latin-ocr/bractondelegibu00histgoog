BRACI'ON: DE LEGIBUS

it will be seen that in two of the larger subgroups of (Ι) which contain MD
there stands out the combination (-OM, MD, HA, W) or (÷0M, HA,
W). This brings up the question as to whether or not MD goes directly
with the other three manuscripts. Probably it does not. For at this place
MD is again associated most closely with MA; again it shows that its exem·
plar had been corrected by some model in the line of (Ill-as proved hythe
variants under OC, MD; and it follows (ΙΙ) where OM, HA, W, do not,
and vice versa. Without doubt, the reason for the apparent agreement of
MD, OM, HA, W, is that though the last three of these manuscripts fall
within group (Ι) they follow less the peculiar traditions of that group than do
the other members of it. As a result of the correction made in MD's
exemplar, that manuscript also is lacking in some of the more characteristic
variants of (Ι). This causes all four of these texts at times to agree together
against the rest of the larger group of which they form a part. But the point
should be emphasized that in doing this they do not have variants pcculiar to
themselves. In disagreeing with the reading of their own group they simply
agree with the reading of practically all the other manuscripts outside of it, so
that their failure to follow the tradition of (Ι) in these places connects them no
more closely with one another than with the majority of the manuscripts in
general. A study of the collation will show that these particular codices have
this sort of agreement with the other manuscripts against those in their own
line some ten or a dozen times. The evidence furnished is pretty conclusive,
and-more than offsets the single time that MD (with MA) agrees with HA
and W against all others. MA, MD, HA, have directum, W has werram,
but OM has the usual, and correct, aaaron. It would be going too far to
even suggest that MD had been either copied from or corrected by a text in
the line of W or HA, and MA copied from MD. In that case MA would
be sure to agree at other times with the MD, OM, HA, W, combination.
Such an agreement it altogether fails to show. Some text in the line of the
common ancestor of OM, HA, W, may have been corrected by one in the
line of MA, MD, to produce the variant, but this is not likely, because OM
shows the correct reading. The variant is a most natural one-W changes
damam to derectam by simply writing r for i. By far the simplest and most
satisfactory explanation is that MA and MD, HA and W, have obtained this
variant by a similar, though independent, process. This same sort of thing
happens so osten in the case of other non-related texts that it can notin any
way be regarded as unusual. The briefest way of giving a clear indication of
