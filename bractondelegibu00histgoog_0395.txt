THE ADDICIONES

possible. The first question is one of authorship. In how far is Bracton
himself responsible for the rubrius? Did he write all of them, or any part of
them? There is nothing which makes it necessary for us to believe that he
must have written them, and on the other hand there is no reason for doubting
that he did.¹ Itis easy to believe that as one generation of manuscript copies
followed another the rubries became somewhat more numerous. All that was
required to create a new rubria was the making of a new paragraph witha
short introductory line stating its purport The manuscripts differ in their
paragraph divisions, they do not always agree on the rubrics. Itis manifestly

³ ι impossible that Bracton should have been responsible for all these different

points of division and all these different, and sometimes conflicting, rubrics.
But in spite of numerous differences-glaring differences if we pick out manu-
scripts and rubrics which are most unlike—there is a general tendency of
agreement in the matter of rubrics which can hardly be explained except on
the basis of a common ancestry for most of them. Certainly there are no
greater discrepancies between the different manuscripts as regards the rubrica,
than in the matter of readings and external arrangement.

It is not necessary to make every extended comparison of the manu-
scripts in order to get a general idea of the way in which they differ from one
another and from V in their treatment of the rubrica. Comparing the rubrics
in V on fs. 115b-1aob with those in six manuscripts OA, MA, LA, ΜΒ, CM,
Y, which for this portion of the text representas many different lines of
descent, we get the following facts (the rubric in V is in each instance given
first in order):

1. Qualiter prmadere debeat iustieiaria' iu itinere suo et quo ardiae. OA,
LA, MA, ΜΒ, have this also, in both their kalendars and their texts (iu the
first three the order of words is changed to read iustieiurii procedere). CM has
it in the text, but in the table ol contenta reads, Qualiter iusticiuria' procedere
debeat iu itirwre suo. Y, which has no kalendar, reads, Qualiter et quo ordine

praedae debeant iustiniani iu itime.

2. De sacrameto duodenae uailitaua electorum ad meadum veritatem iu
placitis cororaae. ΜΒ agrees with V in kalendar and text. OA agrees in the
text, but in its table of contents omits electarrue. Y omits ehctorauu and reads

pharo for phana. MA and LA in both kalendar and text have veredietaun

¹ What amounta to all but procl ol Bracton's authorship is found in the rubric which in tha printed text
comes at sect. l, l. 7. For this the better MSS. agree on, “De dominico domini regia et de condicione
personarum tenentium de dominicos aaa dico de manerio.” Bractou’s use of verbs in the lirat person singular

is rather noticeablea dico, rupmadeo, quara, are frequently found in bis text.
