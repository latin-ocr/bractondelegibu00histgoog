THE ADDICIONES

opposite the place which has been indicated, whoever may have been the
Ι author of it. But in the two different places in which it has been found in the
manuscripts examined it is further away from the correct spot than in V, aud
all three manuscripts which have it in the margin put it opposite the place
where it is inserted in (1). Everything points to its having been an explanatory
afterthought from some one’s pen in the shape of a marginal additia. lts
exact status is not clear. We must regard it as of somewhat doubtful origin,
while acknowledging that the manuscripts are rather favorable to its acceptance
thau otherwise. Fortunately, the passage amounts only to the definition, or
explanation, of a phrase, the practical meaning of incontinenti being illustrated

' , by typical examples on f. 1631).

The second passage about which there is a question as to the correctness
of (ll's position is that which comes on fs. 165-1651). Here as before OA and
LA have in the margin, and Y, (ΖΕ, ML omit, while OD and Mc insert in
the main text. But the position of (Ι) and (ΙΙ) is just reversed, the former
now omitting and the latter giving the additio. P aud W again follow (1),
while LD and ΜΡ go over to the side of (ΙΙ). This creates a situation very
similar to that which exists for the passage on f. 163. For both these
addicientes the evidence of OA, LA, ΟΕ, Υ and ML may be discounted, as
their attitude is the same in either place. In both cases the manuscripts
which give the passage are OD, MC, LD; in one place they are supported by
group (Ι) and in the other by the broadest combination of group (ΙΙ), both (Ι)
and (ΙΙ) being further supported by a few manuscripts which for the main
text—as shown by the collation of fs. 161-162b-do not belong within these
particular groups. OD before this has been guilty of borrowing passages from
(ΙΙ), and so has LD. This passage is so short that a collation of it cannot be
expected to prove much one way or another, but it does not connect OD and
LD in any way closely with OC, as was the case in some of the additiones
previously collated. 1n1.41 OD omits the tamen which occurs in OC, LD,
OA, MC, LA. For the last word on f. 165, LD, with CF and MF, has
secundnm, while the other manuscripts have the usual secundo. OA, MF,
MC, LA, omit the boe in the second line of f. 165b, though OD, LD, OC,
MG, MH, ME, CB, CC, CF, do not. Of all the manuscripts collated, MC

and LA alone omit prinam in the last line off. 165. This is fairly substantial
proof that neither MC nor OD is following (ΙΙ) as far as this particular additio
is concerned. While we cau not be positive that this additio has come from
Bracton, the chances are rather in favor of his having been the author of it. lt
