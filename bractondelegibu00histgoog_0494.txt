BRAC'DON: DE LEGIBUS

Ε.3761),11.12-17. Sed revera. . . .fucr'endo. Begular in OD, MD
(marks additional). Inserted alter acceptio, l. 27, tato, in ΟΕ, ΟΟ (marks
additional); aster cap. VII, l. 376, in MC, LA. Marginal in OA. Omitted
in OB, OF, ΟΕ, OG, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΙ, ΜΕ, ΟΜ, Y. Another passage of
rather uncertain origin which should probably be assigned to Bracton.

F. 377,11. 3-5. Item denegatur. . . ‚dc codem. Regular in OD, OC
(marks additional), MD (marks additional), MC, ME, ΟΜ, ΟΕ, LA. Inserted
alter obiit, 13613761), in OG. Marginal in OA. Omitted in OB, OF,
ΟΕ, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΙ, Υ. In all likelihood this also was written by Bracton.

F. 378,11. atr-44. Er (si autem) aliquando . . . . Natbgt. Begular in
OD, LA, MC. Inserted aster petitur, l. 25, in MH, ΜΕ, ΟΜ. Marginal
in OC (marks additional). Omitted in OA, OB, ΟΕ, OG, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΙ),
ΟΕ, Υ. The case is not among those in the Note Boolr. There are several
authentia citations in the treatise made in the same way and with the same
date (“second year aster the war’'; see Note Book, Ι, 147); but the fact that
OA does aot have this passage as a marginal note, and that CE—which shows
astrong tendenoy in this portion of its text to give the better authenticated
mutamus-omits it, should make us hesitate to assign it definitely to
Bracton.

F. 379, l. l. Cum autem atas . . . . ltoc modo. Regular in MC, ΜΕ,
ΟΕ, ΟΜ, LA, and manuscripts generally. Omitted in (I). Probably not an
addicr'o, but a mere omission by (Ι).

F. 331,11. 15-16. Nat ita. . . . dominun. Regular in OD, OF, LC,
ΜΕ, ΟΜ. Inserted aster martur, 1. 17, in OC, OG, ΟΕ. Marginal in
OA. Omitted in OB, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΟ, ΜΙ), LA, ΜΙ, Υ. This must be put
among the doubtful passages. ,

F. 332, 11. 33-40. Ut probatur . . . . obligatum. Begular in OC, OD,
OF, LC, ΜΕ, ΟΕ. Inserted at the end of sect. 7, in MC, LA. Marginal
in OA. Omitted in OB, OE, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΙ, ΜΙ), Υ. The date given is
probably incorrect3 it should more likely be Hilary term, a. r. 17. The case
itself is in the Note Boolc, No. 748, annotated with three side notes, the last of
which shows a remarkable similarity of expression to the last four lines of
sect. 7 in the treatise. The manuscripts vouch for this addaiu in away which
leaves no reasonable doubt that Bracton was the writer of it.
