BRAC'I'ON: DE LEGIBUS

both the first and second copies being used as exemplars for later manuscripts.
But whether Bracton worked over one or more than one copy of his treatise
would be immaterial as far as the additiones are concerned, were it no't for the
fact that many of the owners or users of the manuscript descendants of the
author's own copy followed his example and kept working over the text to
suit their own ideas, and to keep it up to date, making corrections and adding
marginal passages. It is these later additions which have so complicated the
problem as to make it almost too difficolt to be solved. The discovery of
additional passages is easy enough; the determination as to whether or nota
particrdar addicio was written by Bracton is osten impossible.

In answer to the second question it must be said that there is no
particular form or feature of an addicio by which it may readily be distinguished
from the rest of the text. Not a few of the manuscripts mark some of the
additional passages as such, but in any one codex or group the marked
addicioncs are only a comparatively small proportion of the total number of
additional passages. Nor are all the passages marked as additional, oddtn‘orrat.
Aside from the fact already noted that rubrics are at times marked as

additional, the word which denotes the additional character of the passage, ’

such as Anni-clo, is sometimes so misplaced as not to stand opposite the
piece of text for which it was originally intended. Proof that any particular
passage is an addim can be had only through the comparison of a number of

¹ manuscripts. The typical addida is a passage absent from some manuscripts,

found at different places in others, marked as additional by others, and¹
marginal in yet others. Not all the additiones combine all these features.
Olten the passage is not marked; often it is not found in the margin of any
manuscript; there may be no disagreement among the manuscripts as to
where the passage should be inserted. But in general these arethe character-
istic marks of an addicto which are revealed by a comparison of the manuscripts.

Some of the manuscripts are without marginalia; in others the amount is
excessive. At times this marginal matter is composed almost entirely of
additiones· at other times they form but a small part of the total marginalia,
or they may be lacking altogether. Usually there is little danger of mistaking
an cddicio for anything else, but sometimes there is the question as to whether
writing in the margin which has every appearance of being an addicio is not
alter all an omitted passage put there by some corrector. Omissions ofa
word or two might be inserted between the lines above the place where they
belonged, but the margin was the place which the corrector would of necessity
