PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPPS

certain manuscripts to aplace in (ΙΙΙ) it may he pointed out that OG agrees

with the reading of that group-plus posuerit, etc.,-and that OC does not,
and that ΜΒ and P go with OG and (ΙΙΙ) at this place.

This very short passage is found in only thirty-three of the manuscripts
It was collated primarily to find out how many of the texts had been affected
by the first Statute of Westminster¹ for the period 01 limitation of the assise 01
Mort D’ancestor. Only eight manuscripts give the correct period, and these
are members 01 groups (Ι) and (ΙΙΙ). J udging from the reading of MA and
MN (ΜΒ unfortunately omits just that part of the writ which contains the
period 01 limitation)‚ it is probable that the common ancestor of OB, LF, LG,
gave the period correctly in that quire which is omitted in all three of its
descendants. MC has the altered text, which would naturally lead to the
inference that the exemplar 01 LA had the corrected reading. The collation
brings out a number of sub-groups‚ most of them combinations which have
been found elsewhere. But there should be noticed the combination of MI with
ME, CC, LB, and the period of limitation assigned to the assise in MD and
LD, which in this reading are associated with the group OF, MG, CB, ΗΒ,
Β. Though this short collation furnishes evidence which can be made use of
in a general discussion of the relationship of the manuscripts, there are not
sufficient facts to make possible a separate treatment of all the texts for this
part of their contenta

Forty manuscripts contain this passage. (l) is made up 01 OB, MA,
MB, MD, Ml, MN, LC, LF, LG, HA, Y, which split up into the sub-groups
(OB, MB, ΜΙ, MN, LF, LG), (OB, LF, LG), (MA, MD), and occupy the
positions already assigned to them within the group, as for fs 161-162b, except
perhaps LC, whose position is not sure. In all probability Y occupies here
the same position as for fs. tls-alst. There is no large group definitely
agreeing on characteristic readings which may be designated as (ΙΙ), but as a
nucleus for such a group we have the sub-group (OF, MG, MK, CC, LB‚
LD, X, W), to which should probably be added OM and MF. (OF, MG,
