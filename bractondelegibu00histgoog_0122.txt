donnoniae-donatarius, salt ena-saltim, inermis—inarmis-lnfiermu, summonea-
tur-sumnwniotar, „dud-sicud, warrantum—warantuna-roarentum, show no
true variations,bi1tahly the preferences of individual scribes for certain vowels
and consonantssl· ·Of all the variations those due to differences 1n the matter of
punctuation· aire the most widespread and numerous and of the least determi-
native valae. It would appear that most of the copyists very often put in
their, punctuation marks m the most haphazard sort of way, with no due use of
cape 'oi reason.

··In addition to variants of the types already discussed, there are others
⁹⁴⁰²·of not so general a character which from time to time prove to be non·
determinative. They result largely from the fact that scribes who are not at
all alilre in most of the characteristics of their penmanship‚ may yet have
certain little tricks or idiosyncrasies of writing or grammar which lead, at
times, to mistakes which are identical. The variants so produced are of no
value for purposes of comparison because they represent mere coincidences,
and are therefore non-determinative. No general statement can be made
in regard to thern became they do not lend themselves to a classilication.
Moreover‚ it is not always evident at first sight that they are non-determinative,
their real character not being discovered, perhaps until a knowledge of the
regular grouping of the manuscripts lays bare the facts that those manuscripts
agreeing upon the variant in question form an irregular combination. Included
in this class are the types of variants illustrated by the following examples
For the si laici fuerint, sivem clerica at the end of f. 413b, OC and ΟΕ, ΜΚ
and X read, si laici fuerint, si vero clerici fuerint. These two sets of manu·
seripts are in different lines of descent. Their agreement here is in all
probability explained by the fact that two scribes, working independently of
each other, had each the feeling that the second fuerint should be added to
balance the first. Again at the end of sect. 2, f. 162, we have aive (for vel) in
OC, OG, MD, OF, MG, MC, LA, P, Y, ΜΡ, MI, LC, CA, X, fourteen
manuscripts representing five different lines How shall we explain this except
on the basis that to at least five different scribes, sivefuerit simplem vel violenta
sounded better, or looked better, as sive fuerit simplem sive viobnta? Here, it

¹ Ut and et are interchanged so frequently by the scribes aa to suggest that possibly at times no great
distinction was made between them. Examples of this interchange of the two words will be found in the
collation of the passages from fs.ab‚sb‚aabes‚na,1ol-1oab,ns-n⁵b. Et and eal were constantly inter
changed because of the similarity of their abbreviated forms. Ut had noabbreviation, but one form of the
abbreviated eal might be talren sometimes for at. Seven MSS. hare at for nal (collation of fs. rer-leat),
and five Mss. read vel for at (collation of f. ltab). Theoretically, it would be possible to explain the
interchange of at and ot through ael as an intermediarys but such an explanation is far from simple.
