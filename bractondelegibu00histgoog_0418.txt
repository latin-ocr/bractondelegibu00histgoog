BRACTONz DE LEGIBUS

after that of OA had been written, and the subsequent entry in the margins
of such additional matter as was found. The suggestion that there may be
several different layers of αιίᾱὲάοπεε in OA ean not be seriously considered
because there is nothing in the handwriting or arrangement of the marginal
passages to support it. Moreover, all kinds and types of maniam, authentia,
non-authentia, doubtful, are treated in exactly the same way. It should be
remembered that while most of OA’s main text is certainly of a very early
type, the manuscript itself was copied so late that very far from perfect
manuscripts had already come into existence, and that one of them had
served as an exemplar for the latter portion of the book. That is, the
manuscript was written late enough to make it possible for a comparison made
at the time of writing to yield any addicio which ΟΑ contains. In this
connection there should be pointed out a fact which is not readily apparent,
that in at least one respect ΟΑ is similar to OD. This latter manuscript has
been almost as severely criticised as ΟΑ has been praised. But each
represents a text which in different places follows different traditions, and in
each there has been added to a good basic text an immense amount of
additional matter, not by any means all of which has good claims of having
come from Bracton. The real difference is one of amount almost more than
, of kind. ΟΑ does not have as large an amount of clearly extraneous matter
as OD, and keeps in the margin what the other manuscript puts in the main
text. If OA had been copied and its marginalia put into the body of a new
manuscript text there would have resulted a volume whose context in
principle would have been not unlike OD.

This does not explain why OA fails to have in its text proper many
addr'cioacs which have already become a part of the text of the manuscripts in
(Ι). And any explanation based on evidence furnished by the manuscripts
themselves is seemingly impossible. There is something quite contradictory
to any possible theory in the way in which ΟΑ, CE, and LA omit what are
clearly maeones from Bracton’s own hand. This will become apparent when
the list below is studied. What really prevents any working hypothesis from
being developed is the fact that the three manuscripts just named contradict
one another in their omissions of oddicioaes. Ostentimes two of them will
give what the third omits, or one of them will have a passage not found in
the other two. Speaking generally of all three of these manuscripts it may
be said that a large proportion of all the addit-iones are lacking in their main
texts. But why ΟΕ should omit what OA has in the margin and LA puts in
