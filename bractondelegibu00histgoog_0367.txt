PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

the result of corrections made in exemplars, both ΗΒ and MD being in later
generations than the other two manuscripts. Another fact to be remembered
is that in manuscripts of uneven value indifferent portions of the text the
passages collated may have happened to come in places unusually good or
unusuully poor. Such a change as that which occurs in the figures for OM
when the first long passage is compared with the last shows how much the
same manuscript may vary in two places, A glance at the table on p. 283 will
show how unevenly‚ in those manuscripts which are written in more than one
hand, the work of the different copyists is distributed among the passages
collated. It is altogether possible that a collation of the entire text might
indicate a different relation of the manuscripts as regards the number of
variants Yet from the collation which has been done we may get at least an
approximation of the relative percentage of mistakes in the different texts.
The figures follow:
