sanctos: DE LEGIBUS

question is as to whether or not it will in any way be possible to use the
tabulated data just given so that it will show whether or not the manuscripts,
especially in (ΙΙΙ), maintain in their additiones the same general relationship
as for their main texts, In other words, will it be possible to treat the
manuscripts in (ΙΙΙ) as a group when the question of the authorship of the
addidorves is under consideration, or will it be necessary to make a careful
examination of each manuscript for each passage in order to determine the
origin of the individual additio?

No one of the other manuscripts considered, either within or without
group (ΙΙΙ), has any scheme for the addit-ianm which fits into that division of
the text made by the different hands in OA. For hand II, ΟΑ has the
additional passages mostly, though not entirely, in the margin. LA has
something more than half of the passages in the margin, with about as many
in the main text as are omitted altogether. OD and MC give nearly all the
passages in their main text. ΟΕ most clearly shows lines of demarcation,
having in its text all the additiones between fs lla-151, and omitting every
one between fs. rel-alab. But a further scrutiny makes it plain that these
are but sections of larger blocks of text in ΟΕ which show the same traits, and
do not conform to the boundaries set by OA’s different hands On the basis
of their own standards the manuscripts do not agree as to what is additional
matter. OA has in the margin passages which the other manuscripts omit; it
has also in the margin passages which they (including ΟΕ and LA) give
regularly in the text. LA has in the margin passages which the other
manuscripts (including OA and ΟΕ) have regularly. Both OA and LA
have in the margin passages found in (Ι). ΟΕ gives in its main text
many manontes which are omitted from the text of OA and LA though
found in (Ι). LA basin its text passages which are omitted in the texts
of OA, ΟΕ, (Ι). ΟΕ, OA, LA, (Ι), omit in the main text many passages
found in the other manuscripts. If other portions of text as marked off by
the other hands in OA are examined at all in detail the same general
conditions will be found to exist. LA has marginalia for some parts of its text,
omits the additiones in other places, and gives them in the main text at yet
others. ΟΕ goes on for folio aster folio with no oddieionas in either text or
margin, and then suddenly alters its method and for another long portion of
the treatise incorporates all the additional passages. Changes occur in the
way in which group (Ι) handles the additional passages, while OD, MC, and
(ΙΙ) for the most part continue to give them in the text. But whatever the
