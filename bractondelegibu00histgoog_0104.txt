BRACI'ON: DE LEGIBUS

a passage on f. 70 of V, written in a hand several generations later than that of
the text, is “Nota de casu Willelmi de Colemen.'' Even in his own time
Bracton would not have been the only one interested in the outcome of certain
cases, nor would he alone have had access to the rolla. Some cases must
always have made a deep impression upon the men of a particular time or
district3 the parties involved and their friends would have more reason than the ‘
judges for remembering them. Nor does the fact that these earlier cases
which have been noted in the manuscripts have to do with Bracton’s own
country at all necessarily imply that he was in any way responsible for the
annotatious. Though Bracton himself may never have made a single one of
these marginal references it was inevitable that the earliest cases noted in the
margins should have to do with people and places in the southwest of England.
For the original De Legibus must certainly have been produced in Devon or
the counties close to it. During the last twenty years of his life Bracton had
taken the assises in these districts.lv With almost as much certainty we may
assume that the earliest copies of the work were made in Devonshire and the
surrounding country, and that the book spread from the southwestern counties
outward. It could not happen otherwise than that the Devonshire men,
lawyers and others, who owned the first copies of the book should be interested

in those assises which for so long a time Bracton had taken among them. In ·

the many years of his judicial career he had become acquainted with all the
principal men of the region, many of them had been parties to suits which had
come before him; their interest in some of the cases which he had decided had
been even greater than his own. Small wonder then, if some few years after
his death these men who had known him and had been associated with him,
should have jotted down in those copies of his work which they then
possessed, marginal notes of cases which had concemed and attracted both them
and him'

From the evidence in the manuscripts themselves we must regard the
references to Corbio, Moatocute, Tantali, and other cases near to Bracton's
own time, as standing in the same relationship to the earlier manuscripts that

¹Sea Note Book, Ι, 103-104. The note against case leae in the Note Boot, “Nota casum Hng. iil.
Wymnndi de Ralegha. . . . coram H. de Brattona” (see also Nou Book, l, 101), would indicate that these
friends of Bracton were responsible for at least some of the annotatlons in the Nou Book. For there would be
no point at all in Bracton thus making mention of himself in a citation meant for his own use. lf he remem-
bered the case well enough to make a note of it, “Nota casum Hug. fil. Wymundi de Ralegha” would be all

that was necessary. Some one else is here referring to a roll, and using Bracton's name as he used Rsleigh’s
aud Pateshull's, or as Hengham used that of Henry de Ba (Bracton or Batht).
