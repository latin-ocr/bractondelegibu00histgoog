PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

beginning of chapter one on f. ab show that he, following his Romanlaw
books, is going to devote a section of his work to explaining how the dominion
over things may be acquired by natural right and by civil right. After having
finished with this subject from the side of natural right, he enumeratas the
ways in which dominion over things is acquired by the civil law.¹ Treating
this part of his subject topically‚ he ends with a discussion 01 dr donationibus
propter 0001100 ob 0000001 doira, this topic of dower taking up fs. 92-98. Two
hundred folios further 011,οῐ the begimring 01 De actione 10110, 10 distinctly
refers back to this earlier treatment 01 dower 00 forming a part of that section
01 110 book devoted to the acquiring of dominion over things! Actions begins
onf. 98b.³ This subject is evidently divided into three parts in the author’s
plan, vin, adiscussion of actions in general, English criminal actions, English
civil actions.⁴ The dividing line between criminal actions and civil actions is
plainly seen' The point at which criminal actions begin is not so easily
determinable. In V it comes on f. 1151. Αο has been noticed above,
Bracton first brings in the subject 01 English criminal actions on 1. 1011; takes
up the jurisdiction of the English king on f. 107 ; and devotes some three folios
(loa-112) to good English writs bearing on the itinerant 10011000.ὓ Τ10 mixed
character of this particular portion of the De Legibus is so evident that
Giiterbock in his analysis of the book has the subject of actions in general end
with chapter four on f. 104, and that 01 criminal actions begin with chapter
three on 1. 118, regarding all between as directly connected neither with
what has preceded nor with what is to follow.l The difficulty lies in the fact
