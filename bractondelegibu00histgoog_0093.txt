PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

for instance, that some lawyer in the days of Edward the First was desirous ο1
having a copy ο1 the De Legibus made for him assoon as possible. He takes

⁸ his order to some scriptorium, and the work is started at once, by several

copyists. If the lawyer’s demand for fast work is insistent, the manager ο1
the scriptorium will probably set to work immediately as many copyists as
possible, dividing the work in such away as will allow him to assign portions
of it to others whom he may be able to add from time to time. OA was
apparently made in a hurry for some one who wanted a codex that would be
useful rather than beautiful; everything connected with the book leads to that
inference. Its anatomy would seem to indicate that its exemplar had been
divided at points of more or less prominence in the text in such a way that
nine scribes could have worked at one and the same time without their work
in any way overlapping. Seemingly this number ο1 scribes could not be
procured, for all but two of the quires were written by four penmen who did
the work planned for more. But the parts of the exemplar allotted to these
scribes did not follow one another in regular order. The fact that the same
page in the model would contain the end ο1 one copyist’s work and the
beginning of another’s made it necessary to assign the folios in such a way that
the two men could use the same page at different times without interruption
from one another. How this may have been done will be seen from the
following tabulation of OA’s quire scheme:
