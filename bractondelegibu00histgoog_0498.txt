BRAC'I'ON: DE LEGIBUS

Omitted in OB, OD, MA, MR, MF, ML, MN, Y. Inasmuch as this
passage is found in the manuscripts generally outside of (Ι) 11 should be
assigned 10 Bracton.

F. 418,11. 4-7. Ut aipater . . . . ad oaorem (occulte). Inserted after
supposito, l. 2, 111 ΟΕ, MD, OC (marks additional); aster maaimc, l. 7, in ΜΕ,
ΜΗ, Ρ; atter bastardus, l. 10, in MC, LA. Omitted in OA, MA, ΜΒ,
ΜΟ, ML, MF, MN, OD, ΟΕ, Y. It is possible that the collation of the
texts will discover this addan in some out 01 the way place, even in those
manuscripts which are here listed as omitting it. As it is, enough manuscripts
vouch for it to give it at least a place among the passages of doubtful
authorship.

F. 418,11.81-40. Et quod ad . . . . filio Radalplri. Inserted after capi-
tatem, l. al, in OA, ΟΕ, ΜΕ, ΜΗ; atter sect. 8, 1. 41811,111 ΜΟ, and OC,
ΟΕ (which mark additional). Marginal in LA. Regular in OB, OD, MA,
ΜΒ, MD, MN, Y. See case 287 in the Note Book. This is one of Bracton's
earlier additions

F. 419,11. 27-28. Sicut ia 0144000111. .. .foram ecclesiasticam. Regu-
lar in OC, LA, ΟΕ, CM, MD, MC (repeats). Omitted in OA, OB, OD,
ΟΕ, OF, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΕ, ΜΝ, Υ. It is possible that these few words
represent an additio inserted at this point, but it is far more likely that the
omission in certain manuscripts has resulted from the scribes confusing one od
forum ecclesiasticum with the other. Notice that the words which Bracton
expressly states should not be inserted in this particular writ (et quoniam dairas·
modi inquisitio (cognitio) partina ad foram ecclesiasticam), and which really
determine the point of the passage under discussion, occur in the writs following
shortly alter.

F. 4221), 11. 18-17. Ut probator .. . . abelam. Inserted atter tempas,
l. 41, 1. 422, 111 LA; alter relicto, l. 42, 1. 422, 111 ΜΟ; atter huiusmodi, l. 46,
1411111 OA, CC. Omitted in OB, MA, ΜΒ, MD, MN, ΟΕ, CM. 'I'wo
cases are cited here, one being in the Note Boolc and the other not. Sec Note
Book, II, 684, n. l. The fact that this is a floating additio vouched 101 by
(11) and (HD-irrespective of the fact that 11 is omitted in (1) and, appar-
ently, in (IV)-suggests that it isone of Braeton’s second set 01 marginalia.
As the whole passage is nothing more than a citation 01 two cases, the question
of its authorship is comparatively unimportant‚ except as it might help to
determine to what extent others besides Bracton added these case references
to his treatise.
