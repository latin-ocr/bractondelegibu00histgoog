PBDIGBBE OF THE MANUSCBIPTS

into books. LE, which is likewise divided into cealcooe, does not at all agree
with OF. Sometimes the table of contenta will furnish a scheme of division
which the text will ignore, or vice versa This may be due to the fact that
the kalendaria often written in a hand different from that of the text, perhaps
from a different exemplar. Taken altogether the variety of differentiation is so
great as to require a statement of details before any conclusion can be
reached.

These details can be given most clearly in the following rather tabulated
form. OD, PH, CF, ΕΤ, have the same, or about the same, arrangement as
that given in the Vulgate3 OC has been divided according to the same scheme
by hands much later than that of the text3 MF, only partially arranged,
follows this order.
