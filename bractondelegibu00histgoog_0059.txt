PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPI'S

chapter in Dc dationibus, dealing with the order of actions is in very close
dependence on Roman exemplars. In fact, it is this last chapter which
contains “the most learned piece of Romanism in the whole of Bracton’s
treatise. ”¹ With chapter twelve Bracton finishes with his Roman law books;
with the same chapter he finishes the subject of jurisdiction which he had
begun in chapter eight' It is the end of chapter twelve, not of eight, which

marks the real break; it is at chapter one on 1. nab that he ceases to speculata
and theoriae on Roman suggestions, and tums to a straightforward exposition
of the law of English criminal actions.⁸ With De Corona begins a new
portion of the treatise on one kind of actions, just as tmly as with the Assise
of Novel Disseisin begins another portion on another kind. The arrangement
erne Aetnamve in v is therefore berh logical ena justifiable.

It may be objected that this is going contrary to the scheme of division
in the “better” manuscripts In this matter there are no “better'' manu·
scripts. Itis something quite apart from the question of text value; and
usually, also, external to the text of the individual manuscript. As has been
noticed above, one line of codices, which for convenience we may call the OB
line, is clearly divided into books by rubrics in either the kalendar or the text,
or in both. But there are very few manuscripts in which the division has been
made coincident with the writing of the text, or in the same hand. Usually a ·
different hand from that of the text, sometimes a later hand, has written at the
top of the page or in the side margin, of either the text or the table of
contents, a Liber quanm, or ΙΙΙΙ, or a plain t. More than one set of these
divisions may be found in the same volume. ΜΒ, for instance, originally
divided by capitula, has been again divided according to quires by large,
colored Roman numerals at the top of the pages while a portion of the
kalendar has been divided into books corresponding to the quires. MC is not
divided into books in its text, but in the table of contents a different hand has
made such a division, and this is again noted by yet another hand in the
margin of those pages on which the points of division occur. MA and MD

¹Brootoaoad Ara, 211. lt may be poInted out that though Professor Maitland, following OA, would
end book l on f. lor, in Brootoa aad Aac he contiones Bracton’a text through f. 116, up to the point where V

³ Though hc had oa’s scheme in mInd, the author of Bronton ond Aac, p. 199, could not fail to notice
the continuity of this subjector jurisdiction. “From thir point (i.c., cap. VIII where he takes up the subject
of the iudae) onwards until he begins his account of the crimiual procedure before justices in cyre, he ia
concerned wlth the queatIon oi jurisdiction.”

⁸ “And now at last, all speculative queatIons being solved, Bracton cen turn to the procedure of the
jurnoee in eyre.” Bronton aad Aac, 918.
