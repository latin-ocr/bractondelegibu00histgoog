BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

“praemartuorum ut videri poterit,” f. 2621), and in the margin of the opposite
page, in the same hand as the text, is, “hic deficit maxima pars tertii trac-
tatus libri quarti de assisa mortis antecessoris, videlicet tatum principium
usque hoc, de hoc quod dicit in dominica, etc.’'

CH. Trinity Hall, Cambridge, Early XIV cent, double columns,
charter hand. Sixty folios, beginning at cap. IV, f. ab, with the rubrio
Incipit “Breton liber primus incipit de iuribus Angliae,'' and ending at cap.
XXI, f. 4211). This is an abridgment of Bracbon, too shortened for compari·
son and collation with regular texts, divided into seven books. Some of the
writs are kept in the text, aa also some of the cases; many cases have been
put in the margins. There are a number of marginal 0111111100εο in the text
hand. A few Notas have crept into the main body of the text. 1111181,
1111181, 91116. 62-53 lines to a page.

CI. Trinity college, Cambridge, MS. Ο. 3. 52. XIV cent, single
columns. A volume of miscellaneous legal writings Fs. 1-nab contain
an abridged text of Bracton, called “Breton.'’ (Ρο. 127-270 contain a text
of the Angla-French Brittan, which is here also called “Breton.'’) Although
it begins “Regalem potestatem non solum armis set legibus oportet esse
armatam ut utrumque tempus bellorum et pacis recte gubernetur'' (cf
Glanvill, Fata, and Regiam Maiestatem), the language is that of Bracton,
both writs and cases being preserved. Itis too abridged for text comparison.

At the end is considerable extraneous matter, including a reference to “H. de
Breton'’ and the Statute of Westminster. 911161, 9116, 7115. 4445 lines

to a page.

The text of Bracton takes up 144 folios. Many of the addicioaes are marked.
References 10 the Edwardian Statutes are to be found in the text. A number
of deeds copied at the end of the volume prove that it once belonged to the
