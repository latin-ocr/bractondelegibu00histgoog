υ PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

. Y shows decidedly the best text of any of the manuscripts in this group,

and in this respect it is followed by MN, LG, OD. Not much behind OD,
and having each about the same number of variants come ΟΒ, ΜΒ, LF, and

Of the twelve manuscripts constituting group (Ι) for fs. 413-415b, OB,
LF, LG, MA, ΜΒ, MD, MI, HA, were in the same group for fs 161-162b.
MN, which omitted that portion of the text containing the beginning of the

The nine members of (ΙΙ) fall into the lesser groups of (OA, OF, MG,
CB, CC, ΗΒ, Β), (OA, OF, MG, CC), (OA, CC), (OF, ΜΟ), (CB, ΗΒ, Β),
(CB, ΗΒ), (ΜΚ, Χ). The pair group OA, CC, is related to OF, MG, at no
