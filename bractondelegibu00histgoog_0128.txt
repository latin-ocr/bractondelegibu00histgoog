the curled aa sign take on the essential features of an o; thus q with the ov sign
above (quibas) becomes in another copy qao (q with an ο above), or p with the
curled sign above (post) is thought to be priato (p with au o above).¹

ΙΙΙ. Abbreviations in which the sign used is misplaced or ambiguous.
Po with the or sign above is ponitur or puro according as the sign is over the
oor the pff Α with a certain curved mark at its upper right hand extremity
isoatem, with a similar mark to the right and above it is aliua An a with
another a of a certain kind placed above in one position is alio, with an 0 01
another kind in another position above it is aliqua! Aos may represent either
aliua or aliquos, according to the position of the o and a⁴ In allthese cases
the misplacement of the governing sign or letter is an easy matter unless the
scribe exercises considerable care; all of these words have changed places with
those abbreviated like them. Debet with a dash through theb is deberet, with
the dash over the e, debeat! It is osten difficult to tell for which of these two
letters the dash is intended. When the scribe dispenses with the usual er sign
and uses a mere dash in place of it, we can not be sure whether his lauit (with
the sign over the middle of the word) is meant for babuerit or tabuit. At
times ad becomes mixed up with both aliud (a with d just above and a little
to the right) and aliquid (ad with ani above and between).⁶ In the same way
id, idem, (id with a mark through the d), and illud (i with d a little above and
to the right) are confused.⁷ The abbreviation for infra is distinguished from
that sorita by a dot on either side of thei ; if either 01 these dots is omitted
the longer word is quite apt to be turned into the shorter.⁸ Etiam is changed
to et by the chance omission of the simple dash above the abbreviation for et.
If ascribe forms the abbreviation for id eat (a single vertical stroke with a dot
on either side) hurriedly, without taking his pen from the page in doing it, we
get something which looks like the English letter Z, and which may easily pass
