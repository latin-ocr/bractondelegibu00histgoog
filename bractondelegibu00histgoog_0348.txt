disappointing in the information which they give as to pedigree. A number
of groups stand out distinctly enough, but their connection with one another is
not always revealed. So little light is thrown on the hinship of some of the
individual manuscripts that their relative position can only be guessed at.
Only two of the manuscripts OE and OG, change hands in the space of these
fifteen folios, the change affecting OG but not ΟΕ. Whether any other of
the texts have changed their tradition in the interval is a question that can be
answered only by guessing. To make any inference on the basis of such
meager information as is fumished by the variants would be both unprofitable
and dangerous All that can be done is to gather up such facts as may be of
some use when the combined evidence of the twelve collated passages is
discussed with the purpose of forming a general theory of relationship.

No difficulty is experienced in either of these passages as far as (Ι) is con·

cemed. In both places the group consists of (OB, ΟΕ, MA, ΜΒ, (MD), ΜΙ,
LC, CF, LF, LG, LT), with the sub-groups (OB, LF, LG), (OB, OE, ΜΙ,
LC, (LF), LG), (OE, ΜΙ, LC), (MA, MD), (CF, LT). The graphical
representation would be similar to that which has been made so many times
before, with OE placed in close connection with MI and LC; and CF, LT,
put a little apart from the rest of the group. For (ΙΙ) the largest common
group is (OF, MG, ΜΗ, CB, CM, ΗΒ, LB, B), which is split up into the
smaller combinations (OF, MG, CB, ΗΒ, Β), (ΜΗ, CM, LB), (OF, MG),
(CB, ΗΒ), (ΜΗ, CM). These occupy the same positions that have been
assigned to them before when they have come together3 there is no need of
drawing another diagram for them. In the passage on f. 182b, CC is added to
this group of eight, and the whole group connected in some way with OC, X,
CA, LD. These latter four pair off as (OC, X), (CA, LD). It is to be
suspected that they lie on that side of (ΙΙ) which is nearer (ΙΙΙ). On f. 118
occur the groups (ME, CC, P, W), (ME, W), (CC, P), (OG, OC). A
working hypothesis would put these in (ΙΙ), where they have been found
before, but there is far from enough evidence to prove that they belong in that
place. To the whole group of (ΙΙΙ) should go OA, OD, PH, MC, LA, CE,
ML, Y. The position of the individual codices in this group seems to remain
the same as for f. 96, except that Y, which has changed hands, now belongs
in the line of MC and LA. The general agreement of OD and PH offsets
such variants as boc (in froc), PH, X, Y, and accusationem (accusantem), PH,
OA. OM and HA, which omit the passage on f. 118, have so few variants
that their immediate connection is not at all evident. In the general
