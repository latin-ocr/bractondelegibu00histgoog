nuncroN: DE LEGIBUS

(ΙΙΙ), in both the type and the number of their variants, are far less at
variance with what has been chosen as a standard text for the collated
passages than the manuscripts in either of the other two groups. Further on
the relative value of the different traditions will be discussed in detail, and it
will then be seen that there are reasons for believmg that there may have been
two originals of the Dc Legibus, soto speak. But for the present we may

regard (ΙΙΙ) as a middle group between (1) and (ΙΙ). Thus:

For group (Ι), ΟΒ, LF, LG are all either children or grandchildren of the
same progenitor, and not many generations back their ancestor was the same
as that of MA, ΜΒ, MD, MN. The exact positions οΙ these four latter
manuscripts are not made clear. It has already been said that the immediate
ancestor of MA, MD, was corrected by some model in the line of OC. As
bearing on this statement it may be pointed out that MD has the determi-
native aut duplicari of (ΙΙ) in l. 26, Ι. aab, and that in l. 28 οΙ the next
folio it follows OC and OG by inserting the unusual uhi. In the other
subgroup, P is superior to CC and ΜΕ, and has probably affected them by
direct copying. Thetis the conclusion which must almost certainly be dratm
from a set οΙ three readings in which the other two manuscripts agree with the
corrected P. In l. 15, Ι. 34, ME and CC have solet for the usual non solet,-
the noa is marked out in P. Near the end οΙ Ι. alb, CC and ME read ande
where the other texts have et unda· P has et marked out. On Ι. 35, l. 15,P
has vel per nomen vel nwdam (for per hrodum), and amaea vel is marked out.

At the same place ME and CC read uelper modian. The agreement of ME,
CC, P, with the group OM, HA, MH, CM, LB, in reading aaa for arada aaa,
