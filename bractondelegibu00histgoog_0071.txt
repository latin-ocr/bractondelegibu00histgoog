PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

ment, and general procedure may be known. His intention is “tractare de
huiusmodi et instruere et docere omnes qui edoceri desiderant qualiter
et quo ordine lites et placita decidantur secundum leges et consuetudines
Anglicanas et de huiusmodi habere tractatum. ’' ln every possible way, here
and elsewhere in the first two folioS, he emphasizes the fact that his book is to
be a treatise on English law. Yet he starts out with a quotation from the

. Roman law, and for the first fourth of his treatise, as it now stands, he writes

with the Roman models always within reach. The scope of this volume does
not include a discussion of Bracton’s Romanism.¹ It is in place, however, to
notice that in spite of extensive borrowing from these foreign sources Bracton
did not consider his Roman material other than auxiliary law, He does not,
as Glanvill or Brittan, plunge at once ia nwdios res3 he builds up one point on
another, leads from subject to subject, in a methodical sort of way. He
wishes a well rounded out treatise, a finished work. In places the English law
does not furnish him with just what he wants for a logical sequence of treat-
ment, so he tums to the more orderly arranged Roman law for material to fill
up the gaps He takes as much or as little as he needs. He is especially
indebted to it for fundamental legal definitions and for basio theories. But
always itis subsidiary law, of secondary interest and importance. The often
repeated assertion that Bracton’s book is mainly Roman law in an English
dress is utterly 'without foundation. Such an idea could come only from a
superlicial examination of the first part of his treatise; the statement is true of
only comparatively small portions of his work. His mind is fixed neither
on the courts of J ustinian nor the lecture room of Azo. He is thinking of
England. He does not wish to expound to his fellow countrymen the
doctrines of the jurisconsults or the teachings of the Italian doctors. His one
aim is to put into permanent written form the everyday law which he himself
administers and which Pateshul and Raleigh administered before him.

To the knowledge to be derived from Bracton's preliminary statement of
purpose, is to be added the not inconsiderable amount of information which
the text itself gives, in amore indirect sort of way, as to the composition of

the book. For one thing we can see the progress he is making. He is often '

so conscious of having finished one subject and taken up another that he

²Gssterbock‚ Hanra'eeoe ds Braeton mad eota Verhdltaier mm rtmirebm Raell (Eug. trans. by Brinton
coxa), takes up the general subjectos Bracton and his use of Roman sources. Markland, Broetoa aad Are,
compares two sections of the printed text, fs.1-10,sab-115, with their Romanosque prototypes. In the
appendices is shown Bracton's use of Tancred aud of Bernsrd of Pavia. 'l’lre Rolls Series edition has noted
some, though by no means all, of the places where Bracton is following Roman exemplare in that portion of his
treahse passed over in Breaton ared Aac, vin, fs. 11-98. The references are not always correctly given, however.
