naacroN: DE LEGIBUS

space in his book each topic would require forits treatment. When he chose
De iare peramarum for a title he could gauge the number of folios it would
fill in his manuscript because he knew just how much space it occupied in his ·
Roman exemplar. On the other hand, when “De assisa novae disseisinaa'’ was
taken for a title, though it was a subject large enough for a whole treatise in
itself and would have to be divided into sub-tides, he could not tell the

number of folios which would be devoted to it in the written book. There .

was no possible method of calculation whereby he might know at the start
that Novel Disseisin was to be of almost exactly the same length as Last
Presentation‚ Mort D'ancestor‚ Cosinage, Utrum, and Action for Dower
combined. His leading English titles were broad enough to allow of wide
expansion; that they did expand, that the De Legibus was a work which grew
in scope under the author's pen, is evident beyond the shadow of a doubt.
Moreover‚ it is not at all improbable that the work as he lest it was quite
different from what he had plarmed in the first draft. Until it was actually
written he could only guess as to the probable final form of his text3 he would
have needed the power of some prophetic sight to have seen at the beginning
the ultimate result of his labor. The only actual realities to him at first were
the subjects about which he was going to write; his anticipated text could take
shape in his fancy only through the medium of this series of topica. Nothing
which had been written, or which he himself by any existing standard could
compute, would give him an idea of English law in terms of libri. “Book
two‚” “book three‚” would be at the most expressions of vaguest import until
they were translated into the well-known terms of “placita coronae‚” “assisa
novae disseisinae‚'’ “actio dotis,” etc. Bracton thought, planned, worked on
the basis of subjecta as the text shows. What he was aiming at was a logical
exposition of these subjects. So to write, “ut sciatur quae competat actio, et
quod breve, secundum quod placitum fuerit reale vel personale‚’'¹ was to him
the important thing. He was apparently more interested in his text than in
the arbitrary divisions of that text. In which respect we shall do well to
follow his example.

After stating what his reason is for undertaking to write the treatise‚
Bract0n‚ following Ano, sets forth his subject-matter and outlines his intention.
He is going to write of events in everyday England‚ of everyday cases in
English courts-“facta et casus qui quotidie emergunt et eveniunt in regno
Angliae‚” he says in the Latin, so that the proper form of writ‚ action, enroll-
