THE ADDICIONES

rather more like an annotator and less like Bracton. Since this addicto is at
best no more than a mere notice, and as its presence does not in any way
affect the rest of the text, the safest way isto retain it while emphasizing its
doubtful origin. See Bronton and Aac, 81, n. 4.

F. 7, l. 42. Nec conpelli poterint. . . . nisi noluerint. Regular in OC,

= OD, OF, MC, MD, ME, MG, CM, LA. Omitted in OB, OE, ΜΒ, ΜΝ,

CE, Y. Marked additional in B. Marginal in OA, MA, LC. Probably by
Bracton himself ; atypical asterthought. See Bronton and Aac, 88, n. 2.

F. 8, l. 10. Notaln'c. . . . etconnmnne. Omitted in the manuscripts
generally. Manifestly a late-written note.

F. 10, ll. 21-23. Unde vernn. . . . rodebar egent. Regular in OD.
Omitted in OA, OB, OC, OF, MA, ΜΒ, MC, CE,'CM, and manuscripts

3 generally. Not from Bracton. See Bronton anet Aac, 121.

F. 12, ll. 14-17. Et generaliter (regulariter). . . . ecchenoe Dei. Regu·

nrn oc, on, oa, Mn, colman natione), Mn, necin omitted in

on, ou, ΜΑ, ΜΒ, nc,1.A,cu,v. Markedadditionalbyss. Another

ζ antino about whose origin it is hard to decide. The omission of the passage
³ in OA and the members of group (Ι) can not be taken to mean anything

of special significance, as these manuscripts do not give the additiones in

ἶ this portion of the treatise. But the omission by Mc and LA is signifi·
l cant. The former codex especially is rich in additional passages, particu-

larly those which the weight of evidence tends to assign to Bracton. The
omission of this passage in MC, therefore, argues against its authenticity. In
the form in which it is given in V, this sentence is, in a way, half contra-
dictory to what has immediately preceded it. Bracton is giving a list of
those kinds of persons who are not ableto make a donation. A deaf man,
qni manno non ondit, can not; but a person who is only hard of hearing may.
A dumb person, qni omnino loqui non potest, may (aeneadum quosdam), for he
is able to give his assent by signs and a nod. Then comes the addicto, Et
generaliter tenendam est qnod nutus devectionem faeere non potest, qnia dena·
ttoni ementire non potest, etc. But some of the manuscripts give a reading

Ἰ which supplements instead of opposes what has preceded-Et generaliter

tenendum est qnod nnllna donationem sonere poten qni dmenticni coenentirc non
possit, etc. In this form the passage takes on the appearance of an aster-
thought by Bracton. Whether or not it is we can not ‘with certainty say.
Again the best way out of the difficulty is to retain the passage in the treatise
while pointing out its doubthd authorship.
