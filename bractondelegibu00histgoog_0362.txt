BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

new book from a single exemplar which followed the same tradition through·
out. Or the single exemplar may have followed several traditions. Or each
copyist may have taken his portion of the new book from a different exemplar.
On the other hand, the fact that a book is written in the same hand throughout
does not make inevitable an allegiance to the same tradition in all places. Tor
instance, P is found in different portions of its text in (I), (ΙΙ), (ΙΙΙ), (IV).

Even ME and MH will not submit to any fixed rule in this particular. We
have (ΜΕ, CC, P) in (Ι), and (ΜΗ, CM, LB, OM, HA) in (ΙΙ), Ιοι·
fs. aab-35; (ΜΕ, ΜΗ, CC, LB) in (ΙΙ) for fs. rol-raab (Ρ in (ΙΙΙ)); (ΜΕ,
ΜΗ, ΟΜ) (ΟΜ, Ρ, in (IV) for fs.413-415b; but (ΜΕ, ΜΗ, CM) ÷P,
for f. 96 and Ι. alab, in the first passage at least, in (II); (ΜΕ, CC, P, W2)
in (ΙΙ), probably, for f. 118, and (ΜΗ, CM), CC, in (ΙΙ) for f. laab. W„
(HA, ΟΜ), is found in both (Ι) and (II); W„ with ΜΕ, CC, P, in (II);
W„ probably with (HA, ΟΜ), supposedly in (I); (W, LD,)in(11); (W,
Le) in (IV). There are also the combinations (W, ΟΕ,) and (W, ΟΜ,
ΜΗ, CM, Le„ P).

A considerable number of facts have now been brought forward in regard
to the relationship of the manuscripts in group (IV) and those most closely
allied with them. To these facts may be added what has been said above on
pp. 64 and 66 about the changed order 0f subjects or omission of certain
porticus of text in CF, LT, CC, LD, W. Several of the members of (IV)
were seen to be involved in the matter of leaving blank spaces at certain points
in the text (p. 78 above). Yet all that can be learned from all this information
is that these particular manuscripts constitute, at least for the most part, a
group which, though more or less inter-related at places, follows no line of
relationship which is either constant or well defined. They represent no one
tradition. Constant copying and recopying of texts derived from a mixed
ancestry has produced a medley of traditions. Unless the gaps in the lines of
descent are filled by the discovery of new manuscripts we shall never be able
to know just what has happened. The same results could have been obtained
in several generations of manuscripts through the gradual intermingling of
traditions‚ or in a very short time if· several exemplars were used for the
productiori of each new copy. There are indications which would lead us to
suspect that the real explanation lay in the fact that a number of BractonS, for
the making of 'which a number of models in different lines had been brought
together, were written at the same time in some scriptorium by various, and a
varying number of, scribes who changed from one exemplar to another as
