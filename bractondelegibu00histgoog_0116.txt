BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

At the beginning of the work of collation it was thought that this selection of
several short passages, scattered at intervals through the treatise, would be
sufficient. These nine were accordingly selected, not in a haphazard way, but
with the object of having each passage contain some representative problem in
addition to mere divergences of text reading. For instance, the first passage
was chosen because it contained a typical addicio, long enough to be 01
importance; the second, because it is one of the important, and contradictory,
statements in the treatise as to the theory of kingship3 in addition, these two
selections gave an opportunity of comparing an Azonian passage with one not
taken from Azo. The point of special interest in the section on 1. 96 wa's the
dating of the Statute of Merton; sect. 14, 113210, was chosen because it
contained another kind of oddicio problem, a sentence omitted in some manu·
scripts, inserted as an addicio in others, and used as a rubric in yet others; the
writ on f. 25310 was selected to determine the influence of an early correction3
and so on. As the work progressed, however, it was seen that the amount of
material in these passages was not enough to settle the questions involved.
Not only were the resulting variants for some manuscripts too few to prove
anything definite in regard to those manuscripta, but it was found that so
many of the passages were omitted in one or another of the copies that there
was far less actual collation than was desirable. Το overcome these difficulties
three more passages of considerable length were chosen, one each from some-
where near the beginning, the middle, and the end of the book. Of these
three longer selections the first contained a very excellent collection of addici-
ones of more than usual interest; the second was concemed with both addl'ciones
and the division into books, and in addition furnished several passages in which
the recurrence of similar words or phrases could be counted upon to cause the
scribes to make omissions and mistakes that would produce useful variants; for
the third passage, the longest of all, was chosen a chapter which was full of
a variety of problema, as a study of it will show.

These passages selected later were made so much longer than those
originally chosen because the collation of the shorter ones had shown that the
comparison 01 a few longer portions of text were at least desirable, if not
actually necessary. It very early became apparent that all the variants
obtained were not determinative; an unexpectedly large number were of such
a sort as to render the evidence which might be derived from them inconclu·
sive. A workable number of variants, a number large enough to cover every
contingency of comparison, was to be had only through the collation of a
