Το one studying the printed text, this passage might appear to bean omission
rather than an addicis inasmuch as the words potest et maerore se aptum both
end it and immediately precede it. But the recurrence ο1 these words in V
is due toa repetition for which the manuscripts give no authority, the reont-
tere ooo poteat. . . . se macne being found at but one place in the manuscript
texts, the additio itself either following or preceding. Without the additional
passage, the text reads regularly as in group (1),Eaveroqeaepertineat ad
regem remittere non potest, obligare tameo potest et macrore se ipsam. Item
poterit ..... Group (II) agrees with V, except that all of the addt'eio aster
Mam is omitted. OC and LA, with other manuscripts, insert the passage
