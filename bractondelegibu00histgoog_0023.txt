MANUSCRIPTS

Though this sort of description becomes stereotyped and mechanical it
nevertheless has the advantage of being brief, and of fumishing a set of data
which will remain permanent for purposes of identification, especially when
supplemented by the collation to which certain portions of the text of all the
manuscripts have been subjected.¹

A word should be said here on two other points-the dating of the manu·
scripts under consideration, and the determination of the number of hands
which have had a part in the making of those copied by more thau one
scribe. There is always the desire, sometimes a strong one, to assign a
manuscript definitely to an exact date. But in the case of those manuscripts
in which the character of the writing alone furnishes the evidence of their date
of composition, such a thing is impossible. A given style of writing, more or
less marked by peculiar characteristica will usually last through at least two
generations; and while the temptation always is to assign the earlier date,
the latter would perhaps more often be correct.2 When, therefore, in the
descriptions given below a codex has been labelled “late thirteenth century'’ or
“early fourteenth century,” it simply means that the more distinctive marks
in the writing rather strongly suggest a date on one side or the other of 1300.
Α more careful way, one which has been followed in the case of some copies,
would be ιο use the form “thirteenth-fourteenth century, '' which would make
1300 the centra} point of a period reaching some twenty-five or thirty years in
either direction. It is from this period that by far the larger number of the
extant Braeton manuscripts date.

ln regard ιο the number of copyists employed on those manuscripts which
have been written in several different handS, no hard and fast statements have
been made. Here again the teudency is usually to make assertions more
positive than the cleamess of proof rightly allows. Assar as our manuscripts
are concemed we have as extremes the “book hand” proper and the “court
hand” proper. Within these two types there are various styles‚ especially in
the court hand. Between the two extremes are hands which lean more
strongly towards one than towards the other; some are rightly neither one nor
the other. “Semi-book hand” might at times convey a better impression of
the actual style of writing than “charter hand” For while charter hand as a
