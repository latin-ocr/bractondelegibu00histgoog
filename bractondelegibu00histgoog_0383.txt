PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

give the fuller and therefore more likely later form, “secundum . . . . de
exceptionibus contra petitionem dotis.’' An omission 01 exactly the same
sort is found at the beginning of sect. 2,1 320-“Constitutis igitur partibus
(in iudicio), aut habet petens probationem aut non habet . . . .”-ia iudicio
not being in the traditional text 01 group (1). These two words, which are
not at all necessary as far as the meaning of the passage is concerned‚ might
well have been omitted in the first drafa Just a few lines below this the
reading 01 (1) is, “quia deficere potest probatio licet ius non deficiat,'’ where
the other manuscripts have, “quia deficere poterit probatio licet ius numquam
deficiat.'’ The change from potest to poterit need not be noticed; it could
have come about in several ways. But the substitution of 1101000010 101 aon
is the very thing which makes most emphatic the contrast between probatio
and ias, which is meant to be emphatic. If Braoton wrote aon in his original
drafc, it is very easy to see why he should have changed it to amnquam when
revising his work. On the other hand it is difficult to see how an original
amnquom could have become noa, and all the more so because it is indis-
putably evident that the latter reading came into existence very early. A
consideration of all the variants in the last and longest of the collated passages
which bear on this subject would make the discussion too long. Yet a few of
them should be noticed. In the following passages: “ut suspectus amoveatur
et ei substituatru non suspectus’' (f. 412,1. 4), “ex paenitentia poterit petens
reverti ad inferiora placita'’ (f. 413, l. 22), “Item cum de eadem re alicui
plures conpetant actiones” (f. 4181), 1. 22), “Si autem uterque comitatus
emanator valet’' (1. 4141),1. 9), “Et si civilis sit et poenalis’' (1.415,1.1),
“Qui prius incepit agere aliis praeferatru” (f. 415, 1. 20), “quia abi terminatur
actio finitur breve” (f. 415, 1. 38), the words in italics, which are the
readings of the manuscripts in (ΙΙ) and (111), are replaced in (Ι) by
aamvwaeotor, descendere, competant, nominetur, Stantem, ille, audeam. 11
the connection of each of these words with its passage is studied, and the
probable and possible reasons for the changes examined, it will be seen that
the assumption which offers the most satisfactory explanation is that the
changes are due to the author’s revision. This same supposition is the only
acceptable one in the case of 1111141311, “quae quidem nullatenus mutari
poterunt absque consensu eorundem et voluntate.” Cormasa eorundem et
is the reading of (Ι), the other manuscripts having contraria emendaturi
omitting the ct. Different as the words themselves are, the sense is notat all
