fully considered further on, it is not necessary to take up the matter in any
great detail at this place. At the beginning it may be said that the addimus,
when studied by themselves alone, do not make evident, except in a general
sort of way, the relationship of the manuscripts to one another. This is
largely because there is no definite basis of comparison. We are practically
restricted to detennining the presence or absence of additions in any manu·
script. A classification based simply upon the incorporation of additional
matter would divide the manuscripts into three principal groups: (Ι) those
which have few orno additions, (ΙΙ) those with the addiciooes mainly in the
margin, and (ΙΙΙ) those in which the additions have become a part of the text.
But if all the manuscripts are to be included in these three classes, the lines of
limitation should not be made too rigid. Some of the manuscripts have
uddidoues in both text and margin; some have large portions of their text with
additions, and other large portions without; in some manuscripts additional
passages which have been incorporated into the main body of the text are yet
distinguished from it by being marked as additional. Unfortunately a
classification on these lines helps very little. The divisions thus made may or
may not coincide with a division into family groups. So various might be the
causes which determined the presence or position of an addicio in amanuscript,
so different ostentimes was the source of the text from that of the additions,

that a separate study of both text and addicis will always be necessary to
determine the relationship of either. Several addicioaes occur in those portions
of the text which have been collated below. By that collation it is made
plain that all the manuscripts which agree in omitting a certain addicio, do not
necessarily follow the same line of descent. It shews too, that those manu-
scripts which have this or that addition may be subdivided into smaller groups
distinct from one another. Even more important still is the fact that a

manuscript may agree with one line in its text proper, and with quite another
line in its addiciouea Though ostentimes a particular addicis, or set’ of
additions, may be found running through one line of manuscripts and omitted
in another, this sort of evidence is too uncertain to be trustworthy until
corroborated by facts from other sources As in the case of the main text,
nothing but acollation of the uddiubues will reveal their relationship. This
necessity becomes all the more apparent when it is understood that those
manuscripts which have come from several different exemplars usually treat
the additional passages differently in different places. Owing to the fact that
some manuscripts pretty generally omit the additions it is almost impossible to
