PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSQRJPTS

The matter of proper names in the manuscripts should also be considered
in this connection. Variants derived from proper names, though sometimes of
acertain valuc when supplemented by more trustworthy evidence· of. and by
themselves are of small worth and little use. These proper names seem to
have meant nothing to the copyists, who often entirely failed to rebti: “them
might, and made up for this failure by writing down m their places the· most,
fantastical sort of guesscs.¹ The large number of references to cases talferi·
from the records gave to the copyists a wonderful opportunity for making the
most remarkable mistakes imaginable rn this respect.2 Similar meaningless,
and individual, mistakes were made in copying the citation of passages from
the Roman law, which citations the scribes did not at all understand.

Among other variants of a non-determinative character is ete, which is
sometimes made to take the place of a long phrase, especially in writs and
formulas. Apparently the copyists so often followed their own judgmem, rather
than their models‚ in deciding what portions of the writ should be represented
hythe etc. that we can place little or no dependence upon the significance of
such a shortening of the text in any one manuscript.⁸ Variants caused by
mere differences in spelling the same word are of the non-determinative sort.
Doubtless the¹ scribe many times preferred his own form to that which stood
before him in the exemplar.⁴ Such differences in spelling as exist between

² ln order to give examples oi some of the kinds of errore which might creep into a writ, Bracton uses
his own name, correctly or incorrectly spelled, five times on f. 1881). Here, if anywhere, the scribes might be
expectedtohow something likea general agreement in this matter ol proper names. But out of thirty-six
MSS. compared at this place we get the following variants. (We give them bere in groups corresponding to
the order in which the names that they represent occur in the printed text. The abbreviated forms bave not
been extended becauee ol their ambignityg when Brettone, Brattoao, Brattoaia, are found in the extended
forms it is not well to tamper with the abbreviation Bretton‚ As some copyists omitted even the abbreviation

forms.) 1, Bracton, Brochton‚ Bretton‚ Brocht, Broghton, Brocheton‚ Brotht, Llredechon‚ Brathon‚ Brothe-

copyists.
⁸ Notice the uae of etc. in the writ collated on f. 258b, p. 15⁷, below.

⁴ At times even the word itself was changed to another word meaning the same thing. Thus utlagatio,
abrasio, attegio may be used for one another at the same place by different scribes, while ialoqario and
toleratio may be likewisa interchanged‚ aa the collation of sect. 12, f. 1311) shows.
