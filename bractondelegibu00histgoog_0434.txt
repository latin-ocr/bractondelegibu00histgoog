has done in its own case. But the fact which stands out, especially when the
variant readings in the αᾱάίιίοπεε are studied, is that these passages have been
along time in the text of (Ι). In these variants this group osten stands
noticeably by itself. As bearing on the general relationship not only of (Ι),
ΟΕ, Y, but also of LA and OA, the following variant readings may be given.
The small number of determinative variants which even the long additiones
yield illustrates well the difficulty of trying to solve the whole problem of
the additional passages merely by a collation of some of them. The two
αὼἰὲοἰοπω on fs. 1141141) (Ξ sect 5) give these variants: l. 20, si mulier, OA,
LA, amittes, (Ι), ΟΕ, Υ; Ι. 21, L. prino quod autem ubi dicitur, OA, LA,
L ..... autent tu· dicitur, CE; L. . . . . uhi auten dieitur, (1), Y; l. 18, cun,
(Ι), quod erun, OA, LA, ΟΕ, Υ; l. 24, nuti duas, (Ι), duas nuli, other manu-
scripts; l. 27, proponere possum, (Ι), ΟΕ, Y, passura proponere, OA, LA;
l. 45, ubi, (Ι), ΟΕ, Y, tbi, OA, LA; l. 8, simius et, (Ι), notumque, other
manuscripts. There is no close connection between the manuscripts in (Ι)
representing different sub-groupS, as OB and MA for instance, nor between
ΟΕ and Y; both OA and LA have so many omissions and readings peculias
to themselves alone that they could not possibly have been copied either one
from the other, or even from a common original. CM, which omits the first
of these passages, but not the second, shows no relationship with OA, LA, or
(1), ΟΕ, Υ. The addis-io often lines on f. 1826 yields but two variants which
can be used in this discussion-l. 25, potent, OA, LA, P, potest, ΟΕ, Υ, ( ),
ΟΜ; l. 26, eontrarium, (Ι), probetur contrarium, the other manuscripts. The
long additio which takes up most of sect. 18, f. 188, gives better variant
material, as, l. 4, omit stubi necdeiurenesde gratia (1); l. 10, vera causa, (1);
Ι. 12, madata ratic, OA, LA, praedictarum, (Ι), ΟΕ, Υ, productorum, P, prae·
dictarum causa, CM; l. 18, debeat, ΟΕ, Υ, debuit, other manuscripts; l. 14, vera,
(Ι), causa vera, ΟΕ, Υ, uera sarna, OA, LA, P, CM; l.17, saetam, (Ι), ΟΕ, Υ,
rite soctan, other manuscripts; 1. 20, salone, OA, LA, felonia, ΟΜ, (Ρ seems
to have been corrected from fhlonioe to filare), salonia, (Ι), ΟΕ, Υ; Ι. 22,
onnia (Ι), ad omnia, other manuscripts; l. 81, sit, ΟΕ, Υ, other manuscripts
have suit or suerit· l. 82, alm, OA, LA, in atto, other manuscripts; l. 88,
utlagan' (Ι), ΟΕ, Υ, indagari, other manuscripts; l. 85, omit omnino, (1);
l. 86, de iure non, (Ι), non de iure, other manuscripts; l. 89, en, (Ι), ΟΕ, Υ,
non en, other manuscripts; l. 46, anundus in vita patris utlagatus, ΟΕ, Υ,
OA, antenatus utlagatus in vita patris, (Ι), LA, P, CM. Such indications

of relationship for these passages as the variants bring out connect (Ι) with
