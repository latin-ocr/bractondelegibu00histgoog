PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

But the connection is too close to be explained on the basis of mere chance,
and it is necessary to concede the probability of corrections having been made
in some exemplar through comparison and cross-copying. The association
may be even more direct than tbis, but compared with that which exists
between the members of the OA, OF, group, and between OC, ΟΕ, and OG,
it is not at all close. Whatever it may be, it involves LD, which is frequently
found in agreement with OC and ΟΕ in these places. But LD follows
traditions which are genealogically contradictory. Here, as in otber placeS,
this manuscript has all the earmarks of having been copied from a model, or
models, which had been corrected by manuscripts in other lines. A number
of times it agrees in determinative variants with (ΙΙ) against (IV) or vice
versa. Twice it agrees with ML against the other members of (ΙΙΙ), as where
MC and LA have naam (with group (1)), OC and ΟΕ have υἰΐαηι (against all
others), and ML and LD (with (ΙΙ) and (IV)) have nohum· likewise ML and
LD read eoeigatar where the rest of (ΙΙΙ) follow (ΙΙ) and (IV) in reading
erogatur. Both ML and LD twice agree with the MC, LA, pair group, but
at different places. Lest too much emphasis should be placed upon this, it
may be pointed out that LD twice agrees with MK against all others in
having manibus for amitinibm, and in omitting suevit rationi . . . . dam tantan.
In the same way ML goes with MD, these two alone reading voluntatem

where the other manuscripts give volontate, and having per mortem for the
regular morte. And if ML has quod (for qua) with LA, it has also alter (for

aliua) with LC and dafectm (for metum da errore) with MF. Those who

were responsible for the making of ML were concemed rather with having the
best text in the finest appearing form than with the exact reproduction of any
one exemplar. Its text has come from models in the lines of (ΙΙΙ) and (IV),
while LD bas been affected by (ΙΙ) in addition to (ΙΙΙ) and (IV). MC has
occupied the same position from the beginning. LA is near of kin to MC,
the relationship between the two being more apparent in this passage than
in some of the earlier ones. These two codices show the best texts of any of
the manuscripts in group (ΙΙΙ). On the basis of these facts the relationship
of (ΙΙΙ) may be represented thus:
