THE ADDlCIONES

number by the traditions of (ΙΙ) † (ΙΙΙ). But the passages just considered
are not of these. To be sure, they are vouched for by manuscripts in all three
groups, but because in these additional passages the manuscripts in (Ι) and
(ΙΙΙ) have left the line of their main text, the only tradition which is
represented by these addebamus is that of (ΙΙ). This brings up the question as
to whether (ΙΙ) may not in some instances preserve an additio from Bracton
himself which has not been preserved by either (Ι) or (111). Possibly‚ though
it hardly seems probable. (ΙΙ) is the group whieh especially contains interpo-
lations from a variety of sources not connected with Bracton. A passage for
which the manuscripts of this group alone act as sponsers must inevitably be
regarded with suspicion. Moreover‚ there are several different side lines and
sub-groups within (Ι) and (ΙΙΙ), in some one of which, or among one or
another of which, we might very reasonably expect to find all the additional
passages from Bracton’s own pen. Therefore, any doubtful passage which like
the “addido da curtb” is supported only by the tradition of (ΙΙ), can hardly
hope to be considered a part of the treatise. That this particular addida is a
very old one there can be no doubt-it seems to be a not very distant echo of
the trouble between Henry ΙΙΙ and his barons; but the authority on which it
rests is far too insufficient to allow us to regard Bracton as the author of it.

With the three addidonea just considered should be compared that on f. 3,
which has also been collated for all the extant manuscripts. For the main
text, in spite of some real changes, the division of the manuscripts into
groups is about the same as that for the collated passage on fs. 33·35b, group
(ΙΙΙ) especially including the same manuscripts. itis here made up of OA,
OD, ΟΕ, ΜΟ, LA, PH, the latter manuscript not having been collated for
fs. 33-35b. As a group (Ι) again omits the adculo. It occurs, however, in
MD and ΟΕ, the latter putting it in the margin. Both of these manuscripts
have clearly taken it from sources related to the texts in (ΙΙ). Most of the
manuscripts in group (ΙΙ) give it. It is found in ull the manuscripts in group
(ΙΙΙ) with the exception of ΟΕ, being put in the margin by OA and LA,
and inserted in the text by MC, OD, PH. Here, as elsewhere at the different
points at which they have been compared, OD and PH form a pair group.
They agree with ΟΟ (and a few others) as to where the additio should be
inserted. This raises the question as to whether OD, and therefore PH, has
taken the additio frorn some manuscript in the line of OC. Apparently not.
The combination now seems to be OC, MD, LD, rather than OC, MD, OD.
In the first place, group (ΙΙ), including OC, MD, LD, is distinguished by a
