ground could not be assigned 10 Braeton. At the best, their authorship is
doubtful.

F. 29111, 1125-30. m 999191 poterit . . . . parte 911099. Regular in
OD. Inserted after olginti quatuor, l. 45, in CM, ME. Marginal in OA.
Omitted in OB, OC, OF, OG, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΟ, MD, ΜΙ, ΟΕ, LA, Y.
There is always the possibility that these short addiciones may have esoaped
the examinet in some of the texts through being hidden in out of the way
places, but on the basis of the omissione, as here given, this passage can not be
attributed to Bracton.

Inserted atter capiantur, l. 16, 129211, 111 ME, ΟΜ. MargInal in OA.
Omitted in OB, OC, OF, OG, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΟ, MD, ΜΙ, LA, ΟΕ, Y.
Apparently not from Braeton.

MA, ΜΒ, ΜΟ, ΜΙ, LF, LA, ΟΕ, Y. This adelicia contains a citation given
in Bracton's usual style. The case is not in the Note Boolr. The failure of
LA and MC to vouch for it makes one suspect 11191 OD has taken the passage
from (ΙΙ). Until the text has been collated it will be well to put this in the
list of malama of doubtful authorship.

Ε. 2961),11. 35-40. Et quo casu. . . . filiam 11019911. Regular in OD,
ΜΕ, ΟΜ. Omitted in OB, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΟ, ΜΙ, LA, ΟΕ, Y. MD omits
only the case reference, ut eoram. . . . 11019111. 11 should be remembered
that OA and some of the other manuscripts omit the Action for Dower. This
caseis 1668 111 the Note Boolc. We can not be positive, however, that this is
one of Braoton’s own additions.

Ε. 297,11. 29-25. Sed 91 maluerint. . . . de Bernera. Regulam in OC,
OD. Inserted atter 19199111, l. 21, 111 ΜΕ, ΟΜ. Omitted in OB, MA,
ΜΒ, ΜΟ, ΟΕ, ΟΕ, LA, Y. MD omits only the actual case reference, ut
de. . . . Bernem. The case cited is 1997 in the Note Boolc. In the latter
the last paragraph reads, Et Rogerua 99911 et uocauit inde aa warantum filiam

side note is, Nota quod cadit breve et 199999 aman mun 9999191 90919999
