PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

therefore, before we take up the matter of the disposition of certain blocks of
text by other manuscripts, it will bc well to consider just ¹what it means to
have these same portions of the text set apart in OA through its quire

arrangement. So great has been the prominence given to ΟΑ by the learned
author of Bracton and Azo, so alluringly has he expounded what he con·
sidered to be its claims to a position of preeminence among the Bracton
manuscripts, that any one who would remove it from the pinnacle on which he
has set it—even though it be but to lower it ever so little-must necessarily
meet the arguments which he has brought forward in its favor. The present
writer is forced to take exception to some of Professor Maitland’s statements
in regard to OA. He does so in no spirit of hostile criticism or controversy,
but merely for the purpose of putting a truer valuation on one of the best of
the written copies of Bracton.

The arguments in favor of OA hinge upon the peculiarities of its quire
arrangement. New subjects frequently begin with new quires3 at the end of
the quires there is osten blank parchment, and sometimes evidence that leaves
not written on have been cut away. Professor Maitland saw in this a proof
that the Digby manuscript had been copied from Bracton's own volume.
His idea was that Bracton “might bc compelled by the stress of circumstances
and the gradual evolution of his plan to make new starts from time to time, to
execute now one and now another part of his project, and perhaps to write the
end of his book before he wrote the beginning.’'¹ As a result of this method
“when the work of composition was finished, then he had on his hands various
quires or pecioe of parchment of various sines which were to be bound together.
Blank leaves he would probably cut away, for they might be useful at a future
time; but still his MS. would probably display some traces of the process
which produced it. In particular we shall be‘likely to find the beginning of a
Liber or Capitulum coinciding with the beginning of a peria, while at the end
of a peria we shall bc likely to find either some blank parchment or some
evidence that leaves or parts of leaves have been excised. ”⁹ As this manuscript

is copied, these external features may be reproduced in the earliest of its '

descendants, especially if the original is taken apart and given by quires to
several different scribes3 in the later copieS, however, these features will
disappear. “Hence we obtain two rules of presumption‚ namely, (1) that a
Ms, whose anatomy coincides with divisions of the subject-matter, or, in
