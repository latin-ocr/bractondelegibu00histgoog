'My thanks are also due to the Directors of the Bibliotheque Nationale
for allowing me to consult and photograph the Bracton manuscript Latin 467 4.

Likewise my thanks are due to the Honorable Society of Lincoln's Inn
for the kind permission which allowed me freely tonse, and to photograph
parts of, their manuscripts of Bracton; also to the Honorable Society of
Gray’s Inn for the use of the Godbold manuscript; also to the Honorable
Society of the Middle Temple for the use of the Bracton manuscript in their
possession.

Ι should especially thank those who very generously sent manuscripts from
their own libraries to other places for my inspection: the Marquis of Bath for
sending the Longleat manuscript to the British Museum; the Librarian of
Pembroke, Mr. Ε. Η. Minas, whose active interest and codperation made
my work at Cambridge exceptionally pleasant, for depositing the Pembroke
manuscript for a long time in the University Library; the Librarian of Trinity
Hall, Reverend W. S. Cronia, for a similar kindness3 the Librarian of
Lambeth Palace, Reverend Claude J enkins‚ for sending Lambeth manu·
script 92 to the British Museum to be rotographed3 and the Librarian of York
Minster for allowing a manuscript to be used outside the Library with
increased facilities for study.

Ι would acknowledge‚ also, the generosity of the Director of the Fitz-

william Museum, Mr. Sydney C. Cockerell, in readily permitting me to have
rotographed entire manuscript McClean 145, which Ι had not seen in the
original.

To Canon J. Μ. Wilson Ι am under obligations for the kindness which
gave me every facility for studying the Bracton manuscript in the Cathedral
Library at Worcester.

Ι have to thank the Librarian of the Harvard Law School, Mr. J. H.
Amold‚ for the courtesy which enabled me to examine thoroughly the two
Bracton manuscripts in the Dunn collection.

My interest in Bracton began with astudy of the manuscript in Yale
University Library. That manuscript first known Ι have probably used most,
if for no other reason than that of propinquity. Much of my work has been
done in that library. Το the Librarian and staff Ι am under obligations for
favors stretching over many years.

Among those who have helped me abroad Ι am indebted to Professor
Vinogradoff not only for helpful suggestions in regard to Bracton‚ but for
much kindness during the time that Ι was in Oxford. Ι have to thank
