BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

additional passages in certain blocks of text. ΟΕ agrees no better with Mc
or LA in this respect than it does with OA. No matter what the angle of
approach, there is no method of dealing with the occurrence or omission of
addideram in (ΙΙΙ) as a group which will suggest anything as to the origin
of the passages themselves or the interrelationship of the manuscripts in the
matter of such passages

Though a consideration of the facts tabulated above does not by any
ready method solve the problem of authorship of the addicimus or the relation-
ship of the manuscripts in (ΙΙΙ) in regard to them, it does result in raising
questions, the attempt to answer which requires a still further sitting of the
facts at hand. Not that these questions can always be answered. But some
of the problems are workable enough to be carried at least a certain distance
towards solution. ,

For instance, how may the position taken by (Ι) in this matter be explained?
For by far the greater portion of the treatise the manuscripts in this group omit
the additional passages, but there is one large section of text in which they are
given almost without exception, and another portion in which they sometimes
occur and are sometimes omitted. The additiones on fs. 1-4ab are omitted

without exception. For fs. 45-151 they are given with practically no excep·
tions. On fs. lta-182 they are usually to be found in the text, though

sometimes omitted; on fs. 188-198 they are more osten omitted than given in
the text. From f. 200 on, with some few exceptions, they are omitted.
Comparing other manuscripts for these same blocks of text we find that only
ΟΕ and Y at all come into the scheme of (Ι). For a certain number of
additiones, beginning on f. 12, it looks as though there was a combination
of manuscripts, including 0A, LA, MC, which agreed with (Ι), CE, and Y in
omitting the additional passages. As soon as any detailed comparison is
made, however, it is seen that though ΟΑ consistently omits the additiones in
its main text (as it for the most part does except towards the very end of the
treatise), MC and LA follow several different courses. Though they omit the
additional passages for fs. 12·28b they elsewhere within this particular section
of text (fs 1-4ab) follow no regular rule for either giving or omitting the
addicimus, and disagree with one another in their omissions OD and OC,
with the passages usually in the text, clearly run on their way independently
of one another and of (Ι), CE, Y. Through f. 37 the passages are occasionally
marginal in some manuscripts, particularly in LC and ME, and commencing
with the adacto on f. rob, LA gives half a score of consecutive aduttum in the
