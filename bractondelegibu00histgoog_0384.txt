anaema: DE LEGIBUS

remains the same—that these writs may not be changed except with the
consent of those who have granted and approved them. It is hard to see how
the change between contraria and emnem et could have come about except
through some correction hythe author. Et is really the key word here;
conamen demands it, coenaria does not If the et ia omitted comem makes
nonseuse, while changing the latter word to contraria restores the sense.
Such a change might have been made, by Bracton or others, but it would
have required corneam ct for the original reading. Of course, an original
contraria might have been copied by the scribe of the common ancestor of (Ι)
as curarem through the misreading of an abbreviation, and et put in to make
sense. But this calls for two necessary changes at the same time, early in the
life of the Bracton manuscripts, for this ancestor was a very early copy. Now
usually, except where they might be made by the author himself, a double
alteration of this sort would require at least two manuscript generations, the
scribe of one copy making the first mistake, and some later copyist, or
corrector, making the second change to restore the meaning which the first
error had destroyed. Moreover, it isnot easy to understand how the abbrevia-
tion of either one of these words could have been taken for the other, as the
only point of similarity is the inverted c for con. The change came suddenly
as it came early. All the texts agree with either one reading or the other;
there are no intermediate forms between consensu and contraria. Unlcss we
assume that a double correction was made in the process of revision by the
author himself, whatever may have been his motiva in so doing, this change
must be regarded as unexplainable. As offering additional evidence of
probable changes or additions by Bracton's own hand the following may be
cited: the omission ofin brevi by (Ι) in the sentence “Et illud idem dici
poterit in brevi de warrantia cartae'’ (f. 414,1. 20); tautum in brevi by (1) for
in brevi lantum (f. 414b, l. 8), which could be explained on the basis that some
scribe who was copying the first of these forms omitted the tantum but
discovered his mistake intime to insert the word alter brev& the reading in·
(Ι) “Et eodem modo erunt actiones plures ratione. . . .’' for “Et eodem
modo emnt diversae actiones ratione. . . .'' (1414130) “non fuit in

seisina de re petita vel aliqua parte” by (Ι), for “non fuit in seisina de re
petita tota vel aliquia eius parte'' (f. 4141), l. 27); and the omission of aliquam
partem by (Ι) in “Idem erit si mulier dotem petat per breve de dote aliquam
partem’' (f. 415, l. 14). These passages need not be discussed in detail as their
bearing on what has already been said is apparent.
