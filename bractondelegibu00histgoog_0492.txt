f. 357, 1)) MC; at end of cap. XI, f. 3571), in MD (marks additional).
Marginal in OA, LA, OC (marks additional). Omitted in OB, OG, MA,
ΜΒ, CE, Y. While the evidence of the manuscripts is not strongly favorable
to Bracton as the author of this passage, it is not strongly against him. The
respondeo certainly sounds like Bracton (see comment upon additio on fs. 2121)-
218), but it is far from being positive proof of his authorship. We may say
that probabilities rather point to Bracton as the writer of this addt'eio.

F. 357,11. 23-30. Vel si forte. . . . in boc caea. Regular iu OD, CM.
Inserted thermanticam OF3 aster sect. 2, in MD (marks additional);
aster mdpa, I. 33, in MC; aster deberet, I. 30, in LA. Marginal in OA, OC
(marks additional). Omitted in OB, OG, MA, ΜΒ, CE, Y. This oddtb'o,
apparently supported by (II) and (III), should be attributed to Bracton.

F. 357,11. 44-45. Sed quidsi. . . . ei subveniri. Inserted aster legitimw
l. 39, in MD, ME, CM3 aster eahta, l. 41, in MC, LA. Omitted in OB,
OA, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΝ, CB, Y. Somewhat doubtful, but probably from
Bracton.

OF, MC, MD, ΜΒ, CF, CM, LA. Marginal in OA. Omitted in OB,
MA, MB, MN, Y. Clearly from Bracton.

lar in CB, OC (marks additional). Inserted aster unus, l. 5, in OA, OB,
MA, MB, MC, MD, MN, LA, Y. Omitted in OD, ME, CM. Another
additio about whose authorship there can be no doubt.

Ι CM. Marginal In OA. Omitted in OB, OC, OE, OF, OG, MA, MB,

Mc, MD, CB, LA, Y. Bracton's use of respondeo has already been com·
mented upon. It is altogether improbable, however, that he is responsible
for this addit-io.

F. 3701). A passage not in V. Sed quidsi vir primo. . . . defhrtsione

aster sect. 8, f. 371, in OC (marks additional). Omitted in OB, OD, OE,
OG, MA, MB, MC, LA, CF, Υ. We are not justified in ascribIng this to
Bracton.
