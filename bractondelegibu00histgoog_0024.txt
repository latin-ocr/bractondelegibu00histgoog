BRACI'ON: DE LEGIBUS

type is distinct enough, the varieties cf that type differ among themselves.¹
Doubtless all cf the scribes would be ableto write at least one other style of
hand in addition to the formal book hand; and doubtless alac, it would be
difficult to discover enough points of similarity between two such hands to
make them appear the work of the same man. Sometimes a manuscript will
contain several different styles of handwriting. This brings up the question
as to whether the same scribe has written in more than oue hand, especially
in the case of those copies which have the text proper in one type of hand
and the marginal addicioocs in another. Probably the scribe would confine
himself to one style of writing in a single manuscript. Many, cf course, do;
but we can not be certain that this is always the cose. lt is quite possible that
ascribe commissioned to write a quire for the beginning of abook might copy
itin book hand, and later might write a quire at the end of the book in
charter hand, especially if in the interval some other scribe, for the same
book, had copied other quires in charter hand. For this sort of mingling of
hands is to be found in the written copies of the De Legibus. ln a situation
of this sort all that can be said is that so many hands, i.e., different kinds of
handwriting, are in evidence. But even here there is sometimes difficulty.
lt is often far from easy to pick out the different hands in a manuscript. Not
only may the same scribe form the same letter in different ways in different
places-which makes even the test of comparing individual letters not
altogether satisfactory—but a change cf ink, or pen, or vellum, will sometimes
cause a very decided difference in the general appearance of the writing. A
fact very noticeable in some of these manuscripts is that the same hand,
changing by really imperceptible degrees, writes very differently at the end

of the volume from what it did at the begimring. That this is sometimes due
to haste there can beno doubt, forthere are often signs of hurry at the end
ofa scribe's work which make it evident that he has been willing to sacrifice
much in its appearance for speed. On the other hand, it should be borne in
mind that even under the most favorable conditicns the copying by a single
scribe cf a treatise as long as Bractcn’s would require along time; if inter·
