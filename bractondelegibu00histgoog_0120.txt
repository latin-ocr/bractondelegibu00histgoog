BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

though he may have been upon the context of his exemplar3 how much more
often the medieval scribe, copying mechanically and paying little or no
attention to the meaning of what was being copied, made this mistake, the
collation clearly shows. In one way this particular type of variant has a
determinative value in that an omission of this sort when found in some

manuscripts of a certain group and not in others fumishes an excellent means ·

of checking the order of recopying, it being perfectly evident, of course, that
any copy containing the word or phrase could not have descended from
one in which the omission occurs. Usually, however, the manuscripts affected
by an omission of this kind represent such different lines that the variant has
no determining value.¹

In the same class are variants which result from a change in the order of
two or more consecutive words. Esse ius becomes ias esse, etc. The reason
for the inverted order is not always clear; but the variation can be explained
easily enough. Psychologically, what was read esse ios in the model might be
transposed into ius esse on the newly written page through the mental processes
of the copyist. As amere change in the order of words would not affect the
meaning of the passage, we may suppose that a scribe who had mode an
omission and discovered his mistalre after writing the following word, would
usually imert the omitted word aiter that which in the model it preceded,
rather than malrea correction above the line or in the margin. Seemingly,
also, some of the scribes had ideas of their own as to the correct order of certain
words or kinds of words, and went so far as to alter the text they were copying
when, in this particular, it did not conform to those ideas. At times the
variant due to a change in the order of words is found to exist solely in a
single line of manuscripts, as in the case of probationem habuerit (for habuerit
probationem) in chapter II on f. 320;2 but more often the manuscripts involved
represent a chance, or irregular, combination' The evidence to be derived
from this sort of variant is so far from being of a decisive nature that it is
better not to trust it at all when other variants of a more determinative

¹Notiee especially tha collatino for cap. lV, f. materensibus of this sort. The mansues of the
same words or phrases sometimes caused the scribe to maire just the opposite lrind of mistalre-that of repeat-
ing a passage already copied. For a repetition oi this sort see the collation of f. 415. llere the word servitiam
occurring three times in the space of serenteen words has caused MG to repeat a passage of ten words. ML,
on the other hand, has made the mistake of omitting all between the first and last amima.

the reading of sixteen tiss, belonging to several different groupa.
