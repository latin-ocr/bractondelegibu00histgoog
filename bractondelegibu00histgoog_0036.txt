BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

1. 18901111 is followed by the Action for Dower, which arrangement gives
this MS. the same order of subjects as that found in LE (see below). There

are a few slight gaps in the text, some extraneous matter has crept in, and a
slip of parchment has once or twice been inserted between folios. On a fly
leaf is the name of Edward Henden in two different places, and again, “liber
quondam Edwardi Henden servientis ad legem.’' The records of two
transfers of the MS. are found in the notes, “Bought at an auction of Mr. Le
Neve’s Books in March 1780. N. Hardinge,” and “Bought at an auction of
Mr. P. C. Webb's llooks. March 1771. J. Lowes.’' Thereisno mention
of this MS. in Hunter's catalogue of the MSS. in Lincoln's Inn, as the
catalogue was published in 1838, and the MS. was not presented to the
Society until 1866.
