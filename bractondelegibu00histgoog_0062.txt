BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

possibility of acommon original. The disagreements and variations can be
explained only by the supposition that later men in attempting to make
logical divisions in a long work which the author had not specifically divided‚
were infiuenced rather by their individua} tastes and fancies than by any
scheme inherent in the text itself. This is why there are no “better” manu-
scripts when authority is wanted for a division into books.

But to return to a discussion of the two sehemes which are under considera·
tion. Next in order it is necessary to take up the question as to where the Assise
of Novel Disseisin should begin. OA, OB, etc., decide upon a place two
chapters beyond that selected by V (f. 159b). The rubric to OE's second
book expressly states that book two should include what V has made the first
two chapters of the first treatise in its fourth book; OB includes it in the
matter pertaining to the second book under the more general term of “and
other things as above in the table of contents. ” Now it is another weakness
in the arrangement of OA, OB, ete, that they should include in their second
book, a book devoted to criminal actions, two chapters that are foreign to the
subject. What have these two chapters to do with criminal actions, what has
anda possessio or intrusio to do with placita coronae? Nothing whatsoever.
On the other hand, they are intimately connected with what follows them.
Bracton himself distinctly tells us that he begins his treatment of civil actions
with chapter one on f. 159b—“Dictum est supra de actionibus criminalibus, et
iniuriarum quae personales sunt, et pertinent ad coronam domini regis. Nunc
autem dicendum est de actionibus civilibus.” If this short chapter is read
carefully in connection with what follows, it will be seen to form an introduc-
tion not only to the Assise of Novel Disseisin but also to the other civil
actions, In its distinctions between real and personal actions, between
possession and property, between the different kinds of possession with varying
degrees of right, is found a hint of what is to come even as faras the Writ of
Right.¹ Chapter two discusses at some length the subject of intrusion which
has been introduced in the first chapter, for the reason that intrusion‚ as the
author tells us, “partakes in away of the nature of disseisin.” This subject
out of the way, he can treat of actual disseisin, that which is made “unjustly
and without judgment.” But his real starting point for both the Assise of

¹ With the expressions in this chapter referring to possession, property, and right, compare the opening
lines of the treatises Do Amiso Utnan, Do Ingressa, and Do Brevi ds Raeto. Subiecta have been treated
according to the order outlined in cap. l, f. 159b. Real actions have come before personal, possession bas been
discussed before property, much possession and much right have followed little possession and no right.
Bracton had outlined hia work a long way abead when he wrote this chapter.
