BascroN: DE LEGIBUS

the writ.¹ Only one other of the manuscripts, LA, leaves a space at this
point. By referring to the description given of LA it will be seen that this
codex frequently leaves a space vacant at the end of chapters, sometimes a
space of greater extent than the twenty-one lines left empty here.² So the
question naturally arises as to whether the lines of blank parchment at this
place have any greater significance than an unwritten interval at the end of any
other chapter, or title, as it may more properly be called. ΟΑ itself often
leaves unwritten lines at the end of what are chapters and sections in V, but
the spaces are not nearly as large as that leit vacant here. However, the fact
remains that the two codices which do have an empty space at this point
are accustomed to leave lines blank at similar places elsewhere. It would
mean much more if this particular space in OA and LA had come in the
middle, rather than at the end, of a title. These two manuscripts are closely
connected in places; their agreement here is quite in keeping with a number
of peculiarities limited to themselves alone in other places; it proves nothing at
all as to whether or not Bracton’s own copy had a blank space at this particular
spot. At other places besides this he promises writs which are not forth·
coming, and from time to time the copyists are bothered by these unfulfilled
promises. Every once ina while they leave a number of lines vacant at one
or another of these points, apparently in the belief that their model is not
quite complete in this special passage, and that the writ may be found in
another exemplar. For instance, at the middle of f. autb the writ which we
would naturally look for is omitted in V and in all the manuscripts (which
leave no space for it) with the exception of Y.⁸ Another writ should come at
the end of sect. 7 on f. 800b⁴ No codex gives it, but Y and ΟΕ leave
each espace of eleven lines, ΜΒ a space of seven lines, MH a space of fourteen
lines, CM a space of thirteen lines, MM a space of twelve lines, MN a space
of three lines, and P a space of eleven linea. At the end of sect. ⁶2,
f. 358b, “fiat breve vicecomiti sub tali forma” is followed by the writ itself in

¹ “ln some respecta more important than those yet noticed‚ the copyists seem to have endeavoured to
produces faesimile of their model. On f. 69 of the Vulgata text Bracton says that he is going to give what in
effect would be a writ of ‘formedon in the remainder’= breve omem tole erit, he says, but he gives no writ, and
it is a controverted question whether in his day such a writ had become current. Now in our MS. these words
are followed by a blank space, noleas than five-and-twenty lines being left vacant. This waste of material
ean hardly be explained except by the supposition that in Bracton's own MS. a space was left at thie point by
the author, a space which he hoped to be able to fill up et some future time.’' Bructeri aad Aeo, 948.
