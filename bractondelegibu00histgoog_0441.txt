THE ADDICIONES

And inasmuch as in almost every case the addicto would be but a further
treatment of some suggestion in the main text, either supporting it or contra·
dieting it or limitiug it, the very same words and phrases would have to be
employed in both places. lt is altogether probable that any one reading
Bracton with the intense interest which the writing of au addicto presupposes
would have uneonsciously absorbed so much of Bracton’s style, so to speak,
that his own marginal comments would more or less refleet not only the
substance but also the form of the text which caused them. Bracton has no
style which is peculiarly his own. Legal literature was hardly the ground on
which style could flourish. The very demand for precision in the expression
of legal ideas, the necessity of using constantly recurring phrases and formulas
which had already become stereotyped, lest but little opportunity for the
development of anything which could be called literary characteristics. 'l'alren
as a whole, the De Legibus is unquestionably superior, both as regards diction
and in general literary excellence, to either the earlier work of Glanvill or the
numerous short tracts from the generation aster Bracton. Yet if we choose
certain portions of text in which the different writers are discussing the same
subject, there is noticeable a very considerable degree of similarity both
between Bracton and Glanvill and between Bracton and the later traets.¹
Speaking broadly we may say thet for small portions of text on the same
subject the different legal writers of the thirteenth century show little, if any,
difference of style or expression. Now if the exigeneies of legal phraseology
produce such a likeness between passages in Bracton and similar passages in
other writers, much more do they produce this same likeness between the
- main text of the De Legibus and the intimately connected addicto. Asa
matter of fact, the additio in most cases reads about as the text to which it
refers. Broad lines of divergenoe being thus for the most part automatically
excluded, it is inevitable that the addicam should in most points of compari·
son be much alike. · The form of the additional passage can therefore help but

little in determining its authorship.

¹Tbe similarity between Bracton aud Glanvill is not so'readlly apparent at flrat sight because ol tbe
different arrangement ol matter iu the two treatises. lt shows up very plainly, however, when a detailed
comparison ol correspondiug parts ia made. Ol tbe tracta, the Mam &num ol Heugbam will be found to
agree most closely with Bracton, chaptera ol the former correspouding to lolioa ol the latter as lollowsr l—sss,
