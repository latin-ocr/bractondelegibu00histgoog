PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

started on these shorter quires to get them out of each other‘s way, so to
speak. When they turned to the more extensive portions of their work the
quires were made much longer. As soon as II was through with that last
folio of his first assignment, which contained also the beginning of III's larger
blook of text, he turned it over to the latter, and for himself started in on that
folio in the exemplar immediately following the last one in III’s first lot.
From the point at which III began (f. 98b of V) there was counted back a
number of folios estimated to be sufficient for about two quires in the new
book, and hand IV was set to work at aprominent break in the text (f. 62b
osv) somewhere near the place arrived at by that reckoning. But this amount
of text was not quite enough for two quires of eight folios each in the kind of
hand IV wrote, so he was left with waste vellum at the end of his second
quire. As soon as IV had finished with the first folio from which he was
copying he turned it over to ΙΙΙ, who was thus able to copy all from the point
at which ΙΙ left off up to the place where IV began. Out of this amount of
copy III made nearly, but not quite, three quires. Now we should expect to

, find some evidence of division at the point where the civil actions begin. This

place might have been chosen as the beginning of a new assignment in the
scheme of allotment, but all evidence as to that would have disappeared, of
course, after ΙΙ had been given consecutive work on either side of that point.
If one of our former assumptions is correct, it would seem that before the
work had been going on very long it became evident to the master of the
scriptoriam that the number of scribes whom he could set at this particular task
was going to grow less rather than more, and that he was therefore compelled
to give to a smaller number of men a relatively larger amount of work than he
had originally planned for each. This would explain why the blocks of text
written by the same hand show such adecided tendency to increase in length as
the work goes on. Alter hand IV had finished his first section of text, ending on
f. 98 of V, he was set to work on the passage beginning on f. 214 of v-quire P
of ΟΑ. It is perfectly plain that folios had been counted backward from the
end of N ovel Disseisin in exactly the same way that they had been counted
backward from the beginning of De Actiooibus. It was estimated that from
f. 214 to f. 237b there would be enough material to form aquire in the new book.
But this time the estimate was too generous as before it had been too scant3
the scribe was obliged to write an extra page over and above his quire of eight
folios.¹ Hand V was commissioned to write a quire beginning with the Assise

² ‘rho bosia of apportionment was without any doubt the quire (or quires) of eight foliot.
