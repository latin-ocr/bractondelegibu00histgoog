ing of proper positions to those which in the last passage collated were put into
aseparate group by themselves, (IV), (OM, ME, MH, CM, P, LC, W, LT,
ΜΜ). Το make the discussion complete there should be added to these CF
(which though lacking in this part of the text is elsewhere always in a pair
group with LT), HA (because of its close connection with OM), ΜΕ (related
in places to P), and CC (because of the occurrence in more than one place of
the sub-group ME, CC, Ρ).

CF and LT are most easily disposed o'f for the present. Found in agree-
ment at different places with all three of the principal groups, though usually
with either (Ι) or (ΙΙ), they follow no single line of descent though each is
written throughout in the same hand. Somewhere back in their ancestry was
a manuscript which had been copied from more than one model. Nearer to
them was another ancestor which had been corrected in places by a text, or
texts, in one or more different lines. The single position which will best
receive them is the doubtful region between (Ι) and (ΙΙ).

ΜΜ is a fragment, containing only fs. asab-442 of the printed text. lt
has therefore been collated in only three of the passages. In all of these it
shows an excellent text and occupics the position assigned to it for fs. 413-415b.

For the other members of (IV), and the allied manuscripts, it will be
advisable to follow the method employed in discussing the other three groups
and take up each passage in turn.

Fs. aab-aa-ME, CC, P, form a distinct sub-group in (Ι) with ΜΕ and
Y not far removed from P. CF and ΕΤ are also in (Ι), but not closely
related to any other group within it. OM, HA, MH, CM (and ΕΒ), are in a
sub-group under (ΙΙ); LC is in another sub-group with ΜΙ, ΕΙ), CA. MM
and W are not collated. There are a few scattered variants, some of which
have been noticed already (p. 248), which bring these manuscripts together at
placeS, viz„ anu (undo una), ME, CC, P, ÷0M‚ HA, MH, CM, LB; conditio
vel dicho (dictio), ME, CC, P, ÷Lc, ΜΙ, MF3 ct (quia), ME, CC, P, †LC, ΜΙ,
ΕΙ), ΕΒ; solet (non solet), ME, CC, P, ÷LC; in (si in), ME, CC, P, †LC;

ut (vel), ME, CC, P, †MH, CM, OC. In agreement on the first of these
variants are all the manuscripts in (IV) which have been collated for this
passage except LT. The second variant connects the LC, ΜΙ, pair group
with both ΜΕ and P. Bearing yet further on this connection are estsine
(nne), ΜΙ, LC, MF, and se totum non (ae totum), ΜΙ, LC,-with P, ΜΕ,
ΕΙ), ΜΕ, reading sc non totum. More numerous arethe variants which bring
LC into association with the ME, CC, P, group. But all the above instantes
