THE ADDICIONES

different hands. At this place the text and the rubrics scrawled at the bottom
of the pages are in hand I; the rubrics in red ink are in hand ΙΙΙ, which has
written the greater portion of the text, the rubrics, and a large amount of
marginalia of one kind or another. Everything points to a third scribe having
finished a book left incompleta by two others. The different hands do not
follow the same text tradition. They were therefore probably from different
exemplars. In which case it may be taken for granted that the third scribe
used as his model for the rubrics which he wrote in the text copied by the first
scribe, not the rubrics which that copyist had written in lead at the bottom of
the pages, but the rubrics which were to be found in the manuscript which
he was using as the exemplar for his own portion of the work. In this
connection it may be pointed out that the rubrio which was discussed when
the subject of the division of the treatise into parts was under consideration
(f. 107, cap. IX, sect. 1), is given inY in red ink as, De regimine iurisdictionem
regni, and is scrawled at the bottom of the page in the form, De regimine
iamdictionts regni qaia dc sacerdotio nibil adpraesens. If additional evidence
is needed to prove that the rubrics in a manuscript may represent a different
tradition from that of the text it is only necessary to compare the relationship
which OA, LA, MA, ΜΒ, CM, Y, show in their text for the passage collated
on f. 118 with that which is made evident in these rubrics for fs. 115h120b.

So much for the facts in regard to the rubrica These facts explain why
the rubrics in themselves, just as the additiones in themselves, can not be
depended upon to indicate the pedigree of the text. They reveal, too, a
situation which made it almost inevitable that the same sentence should at
times be made part of the text by some manuscripts, should be treated as an
addicto by others, and by yet others should be written as a rubric.

As a preliminary to any direct discussion of the addicioaes two questions
must be answered: (1) What is an addicto? and (2) How is an adnuo to be
distinguished from the text propera The simplest answer to the first question
is that an additio is any passage, irrespective of its length, which the
manuscripts prove was added to Bracton's original drafc of his work. Nothing
is more plainly shown by the manuscripts than that aster writing out the first
copy of his treatise Bracton kept adding thereto. The definition of an
“original draft” must not be made too rigid. As has already been suggested,
the assumption which will best explain the peculiarities of the different text
traditions is that a first copy, plus its marginalia added by Bracton, was copied
as a new text, and that in this second copy Bracton wrote other marginalia,
