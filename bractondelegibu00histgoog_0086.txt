BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

Directly affected by this variation or omission of certain parts of the text
are OA, OF, MG, MK, ML, CA, CB, CD, LD, LE, LF, Β, W; and
connected with at least two of this list because of the “praemortuorum”
beginning, are CC, CF, LA, LT. By referring to the descriptions given of
the manuscripts and to the collation below, it will be seen that this list, though
there are good copies in it, can not be considered as representative of the best
codices of Bracton’s work. Most of the manuscripts here grouped together
are distinctly second rate, or even worse. Four of them are abridgments in
one form or another of the parent treatise. Seven ol them are written in
more than one hand; in five of them, at least five different copyists have bad a
share in making the book. of those written throughout in a single hand six
have been copied either from more than one exemplar, or from a model derived
from more than one source, as they agree at different places with different
lines. In other words, the majority of these manuscripts are just the kind in
which we should expect to find evidence that different blocks of text had been
copied at different times or from different originale. And clearly enough that
is what has happened here. But very little else is clear. From the fact
that the copies which make these changes practically agree as to the portions
of text to be transposed, it would appear that the manuscripts are in some way
related to one another3 that they are not at all in agreement as to where the
transposed parts should be inserted, indicates that they are not all closely
connected. Just what the exact relationship is could be detennined only by a
thorough collation of each codex at those places where the variations occur.¹
But as those parts of the De Legibus do not, with one exception,² fall within
the limits of the passages collated below, it becomes necessary to depend upon
information of a more general character. Fortunately the collation which has
been made shows well enough the general relationship of the many manu-
scripta, so that the explanation of the vagaries of these few becomes morea

¹ A collation ol the lew MSS. which bave the same variation at any one point would not do; lor any real
compenson the collation ol a large number would be necessary. Osten all the MSS. agree against the printed
text. Larga groups differing from other large grorms break up into smaller groups as a result ol constant
recopying. A difference oi only two or three manuscript generations would be required to put MSS. sprung
from the same ancestor into different smaller groups. For instance, as bearing directly on some ol the MSS.
here under discussion, take the collation ou fs. 413-415b. OA, OF, MG, MK, CB, CC, B, X, part of a much
larger group, are seen to form a distinct smaller group by themselves. This ln turn is broken up into four
smaller groups ol ΟΑ and CC, OF and MG, MK and X, CB and B, any one ol which frequently differs from
the others. lt would be possible within these three folios to pick out passages ol considerable length, in which
a collation of OA, OF, MK, CB, alone, would show nothing, or next to nothing, of the relationship existiug
between them. For the same reason the collation ol parts of fs. eabae, etc„ lor the lew MSS. concerned with
a change of order there, could be expected to produce ouly meagoe results.
