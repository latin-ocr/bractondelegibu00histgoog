of contradictions, other manuscripts in the same line may be consulted. If
both MA and ΜΒ agree against OB, the reading of LG should be looked up.

Where either one of the other two manuscripts sides with OB against the
other, MN should be brought into use. MN may also be used to supply the
deficiency caused by the lomna in OB and LG. In places where it may be
thought necessary to have all possible information MI or LC may be consulted,
provided of course that in these particular places they are to be found in (Ι).
For the latter part of the book the readings of OD and Y will help to fix the
traditional text of (Ι).

OA, OD, MC, ΟΕ, LA, PH, all give the traditions of (111), except in
the latter part of the text. PH is quite inaccessible at the present time, but
as in most places at least, and probably throughout, PH and OD are in close
agreement, the latter manuscript may be used to represent the pair. OD,
which was the manuscript most used hythe editor of the Rolls Series edition
of Bracton, has been very severely criticised because of the extraneous matter
which is found in parts of its text. This brings up the question as to whether
or not we should lay aside, once and for all, those manuscripts in which there
is any considerable amount of additional or non-Bracton material. Not
necessarily so. -Each part of the manuscript must be judged separately.
Because a reference to the statutes of Edward Ι occurs in one part it does not
follow that all parts of the text are similarly corrupted. Though many of the
texts which contain passages that Bracton never wrote are corrupt in their
version of what he did write, there are some manuscripts which bave not a
little outside matter and yet, except for this, show a good text. OD must be
put in the latter class. In all of the passages collated‚ it shows up well, far
better than the majority of the manuscripts. Moreover, its non-Bracton
passages are of a type which clearly reveal their identity; they stand out from
the rest of the text. So while OD would not be a good manuscript to use
alone in making a new text of Bracton, it may be used to advantage if a
critical comparison with others is allowed to separate what is good init from
what is not. The related manuscripts MC and LA, which are consistently in
(ΙΙΙ) from beginning to end, are both important. MC has most of the
oddiciovtea in the text, while LA puts a large proportion of its additional
passages in the margins. Attention has already been called to the fact that
there is a noticeable agreement between LA and OA in the matter of the
addicimus, the point at which some of the quires begin, and in the leaving of
spaees. For this reason LA will have to be thoroughly compared with both
