1)) ΟΟ, MD; aster potest, l. 23, in ΜΙ. Marginal in LA. Omitted in OA,
OB, ΜΒ, ΜΕ, ΜΝ, CC, ΟΕ. As this passage occurs in a portion 01 the text
where the addideras are very generally given by group (Ι), the fact that these
manuscripts repudiate this passage is strong evidence 01 0 non-Bracton origin.

F. 461), 11. 15-92. Si tenens naas. . . . stapra 11101010 est. Regular in
OD, OF (marks additional). Inserted atter dcent, l. 35, in MD, ΟΟ (marks
additional); aster dissimulaverit, 1. 11, in OB, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΟ, ME, MD
(which agrees also with OC), MN, ΟΕ, W; aster prohibetur, l. 09, in OM,
MH, and MG, B (which mark additional). Marginal in LA. Omitted in

Omitted in OA. Another addicto which contains within itself a reference 10

a judgment badly given. This should be compared with the similar remarks
in the additional passages on fs. 29, 45. See Note Boolc, I, 89, 40, thr a
discussion 01 this case. On every basis 01 determination, this is an addicto
from Bracton.

mntem, l. 24, in CB (marks additional). Regular in OB, MA, MB, MC,

discussion of this passage on p. 061, above.
