PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

trend of their texts they follow (ΙΙΙ). Two variants, not altogether deter-
minative, associate them with LD, which is found in agreement with both

(ΙΙ) and (ΙΙΙ). W, which, like LD, shows a poor text in these passages,
is almost hopelessly mixed in its agreements—(ME, CC, P, W), (OB,
LG, W), (LD, W), (ML, W), (ΜΒ, W), (CB, W), Ι an agreement
with the larger OF group, for f. 118; and (B, ΗΒ, Χ, W), (ΜΕ, CA, LC,
W), (OC, X, B, W-this combination occurs twice), (ΟΜ, ΗΑ, ΜΕ, CB,
LD, W), (ML, CA, LD, LF, P, W), on f. 132b. lt would appear that

there is some connection between OC, X, B, W, at this place, but from the
evidence at hand it is not possible to make out just what the relationship is.
Comparatively so few of the texts have the additio, or rubric, in the
second of these passages that it need not be discussed here, though it will be
secuto have an importance when the addicimus are considered. It may be
pointed out in passing, however, that CB, CB, ΗΒ, and those members of (Ι)
which have the rubrio, show relationship3 that MH, LB, B, are made into a
group hythe position they give the rubric; that MA and MD, though they

Ι agree with OD and PH as to the position of the passage, follow the line of

OB, CE, CB, etc, in their text readings

Fomo 179b

Forty manuscripts have been collated for this passage, which on account
of its proximity would naturally be compared with the passage on fs.161-
162b. In the main the agreement is the same. For (Ι) we have OB, MA,
ΜΒ, MD, MI, LC, CM, LF, LG, and possibly OM, HA, W, OG, Y. The
smaller groups are (OB, LF, LG), (MA, MD), (ΜΙ, LC, CM). There is a
question as to the position of the pair group HA, OM, which is found also
with (ΙΙΙ). On fs. 161-162b, OM, HA, W, were seen to form a group. No
such combination is visible here, perhaps because of the paucity of variants, or ·
from the fact that W has changed its hand in the interval. These three manu-
scripts, together with OG and Y, twice agree with (Ι), but the variants which
produce this agreement are not as decisive as might be wished, one being a
mere transposition of two words and the other an omission which quite clearly
is ducto the confusion caused by two separate sentences beginning with the
same words. The agreement of OM and HA with (HD-consistat for
corastat-is of a sort which it would not be well to regard as wholly
determinative; it may be explained in more than one way, and does not at all
