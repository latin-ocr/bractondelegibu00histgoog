great distance. For the other seven manuscripts the positions arc the same as
those already assigned. MK, X, show what is clearly the result of corrections
from a text in the line of (Ι) having been made in some exemplar. Taken
collectively‚ the manuscripts in this group show'by far the poorest texts of all .
those collated for this passage.

The manuscripts assigned to group (ΙΙΙ) fall naturally into three divisions,
OC, Cla, and OG (which is fragmentary‚ and collated only in places) forming
one combination, MC and LA constituting a pair group, and ML, LD,
standing apart. It has been pointed out that all of these texts agree with
group (IV), against all otherS, in assigning the case on f. 413 to Roget de
Turkilby. In reading diversitatem for the usual varietatem they agree with
most of the members of (IV) and two of the texts in (Ι). This may possibly
be a case where the scribes have exercised a certain independence of choice; it .
may have been produced by comparison and copying3 but it is more reasonable
to regard the word as a variant belonging to the tradition of (ΙΙΙ) and (IV),
which are certainly related groups, On the other hand, OC and ΟΕ are in
some way connected with (ΙΙ), as is shown by the fairly large number of

variants common to the two groups (OA, OF, OC, MG, CC, ΟΕ) and (OA,

OC, CC, ΟΕ). But this relationship is not close. The agreement of OC and
ΟΕ with these two sub-groups is not of the clear-cut and decisive kind.
Many of the variants are of a not altogether determinative type; half of them
are found in at least one other manuscript outside of the immediate group.
