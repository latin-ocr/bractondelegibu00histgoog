PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

number 01 copyists he had to adopt the unusual expedient of having the same
scribe copy non-contiguous portions.

We can not be sure, of course, that OA was made from a single exemplar.
The suggestions which have just been made as to the probable way in which
OA was constructed are all the more reasonable because they offer the best
possible explanation of the seemingly erratic¹ way in which the work was
apportioned to the various scribes The important fact to be kept in mind is
that the peculiar arrangement of OA by quires does not in the least compel us
10 believe that its immediate ancestor was Bracton’s own copy.¹ Any ordinary
manuscript as an exemplar could have given it the same unusual form. For
that form dependcd upon the plan of construction followed, not upon the
exemplam it would have been the same in principle whether OA had been
derived directly from one or from ten models, What we can be sure of is that
OA was copied from more than one exemplar, or from one derived from more
than a single source, for, as the collation shows, the Digby manuscript agrees
in different places with different lines. Be its ancestry what it may, it most
certainly is not a primary copy of the original De Legibus.¹

But a manuscript may not be a primary copy and yet be very close to the
original. Before leaving OA it will be well to look into some of the other
claims which have been advanced to show that it was near in order of
derivation to the first book of its kind. At the end of chapter XXXI on
f. 69 of V Bracton promises to give a writ, which is not, however, to be found
in the text. OA on its thirty-ninth folio leaves espace of twenty-five lines at
this place, presumably for the writ, A great deal is made out of this by the
author of Bracton and Azo as showing that Digby 222 is reproducing here a
vacant space in the original in which Bracton intended to, but did not, insert

tbe same way quires Q and R overlap with ultonem pramortworum post mortuorum for the regular 0110111111

'Maitland seems 10 bave begun 10 realize this fact before he had finiebed with ΟΑ. On p. 248 of
Bronton aad Aac he says, “l must add, however, that even the Digby MS„ faithful though it may be, bes
received 11110 its text at least one passage which must have once stood in the margin. The case isan extremely
clear one. On f. 2201) the Vulgata gives a passage in which what is obviously a romanasque 1111111010 derived
from Pardus has forced its way into the middle of a sentence and made nonsense ..... Uaeful, therefore,
though that MS. will be when the treatise is to be edited‚ we can 001 accept it as a perfect copy of tbe auto·
grapb, and indeed in small matters it not unfrequently gives a worse text than may be found elsewhere.”
