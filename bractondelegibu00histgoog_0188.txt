BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

(tl-¹ In a similar way MN reads bum with tis above (mm) at a place where
the copies disagree between humititatis and humanitatis* Who will tell us how
to extend the shortened form quiet, when the variants are quiete, quietum,
quietam? When the text has si mulier and the variant is simliter, shall we
read OA's s with r above (ζ) for similiter or super?⁸ Have we a right to extend
the simple R to the usual Rogerus when Robertus occurs as a variant 2⁴ When
ascribe makes his initialu and u alike, shall we interpret his v with m over it
(2) as uerum where the other texts have utrum?⁵ When from the only four
manuscripts which extend the word we get eloneo, clamio, clamore, how shall
we write out in full the abbreviation of the others clam. ,θ’ In such expressions
as adprobandum exceptionem we can not be sure as to whether Bracton himself
used the gerund or gerundive‚ because by far the greater number of the codices
will be sure to give the ambiguous protana, while the manuscripts which do
write out the word in full will be about equally divided between the um and
the am endings. There are two factors which tend to increase the inherent
ambiguity of the abbreviations in this class. One is the fact that some of the
copyists pretty generally dispense with the more distinguishing abbreviation
signs, such as those for is, os, us, er, re, ur, etc, and use in their places the
less discriminating dash. Moreover, the desire of the scribes to save time and
space by abbreviating as much as possible formulas which were perfectly well·
known in their own day, has led to some words in those formulas being so
consistently abbreviated that we are left in doubt asto just what the full form
of the word should be. In addition to clam, and proband, just now dis· .
cussed, there are many other words, occurring especially in the writs‚ which are
variously given by the few scribes who write them in full. Thus, for instance,
we find both summane and sumvaoaeua for the usual sum.,⁷ and communia and
commitata for the more osten written com⁸ It would be possible to go on

giving examples of these ambiguous abbreviations, but enough have been
brought forward to show the principal problema which result from them.
