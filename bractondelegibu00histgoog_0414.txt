BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

this passage is clearly one common to both (ΙΙ) and (ΙΙΙ), a general similarity
being shown by the sub-groups of these two main groups in both text and
ardeia Itis of the same general type as the addicis on f. 3 already discussed.
Because of the support given it by the manuscripts we need have no hesitation
in ascribing it to Bracton‚ in spite of the fact that it is not found in (Ι). ,

Another fact which the collation makes evident is that some of the
references to cases are αᾶάοὶτοπω. In this connection should be discussed the
case of Reginald Murdac on f. 320, and the two cases on f. 413. But this
discussion is deferred, as the whole subject of the case references is to be
considered later.

As supplementing the collation there is to be used such evidence as may
be derived from the presence or absence of different muhamas in particular
manuscripts, as indicated in the list below. Here certain facts stand out
prominently enough, but we can not always be sure of the meaning they
convey. The information given is not at all detailed‚ and is ofa sort which
requires careful use. In making out this list only from one-third to one-half
of the whole number of manuscripts have usually been compared for any one
adelicia. There are no variant readings to help out. But by selecting for
comparison manuscripts which are representative of the larger groups and
sub-groups it has been possible to get a very fair idea of to what extent the
various family groups are willing to vouch for a given addicio. From the
data furnished we are able to tell whether an addicio is found in the manuscripts
generally, or in the members of only a single group, or in most manuscripts
⁸ outside of a single group. The collation of the additional passages has shown
very clearly that the mere fact of an adelicia being found in a majority of the
manuscripts is no proof of its having corne from Bracton. For many portions
of the text the manuscripts which belong in (ΙΙ) outnumber those in (Ι) and
(III) combined. If majorities are to decide the fate of some of the addiciones
the counting must be by the larger groups and not by individual manuscripts.
In determining the probable origin of an addicio it is necessary to know how
many of the group traditions are behind it, rather than the number of
manuscripts in which it is to be found. To discover this it was not necessary
to compare all the manuscripts, but only enough to make clear beyond any
doubt the attitude of the groups as such toward each addicio.

In the list are two types of addicioncs which present no difficulties what-
soever—one the addicio which is found in practically all manuscripts in every
line, and the other the adacio which the manuscripts almost without exception
