PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

matter of interest than of necessity. What we see is that there are principally
concerned two large sections of text, fs. oab-98, and De Actione Dotis The
former is found in three unusual places, or rather four, if we count the
transposition of fs. 62b118 in LF. Outside of its regular place Dower is found
in three other places in addition to being sometimes omitted.¹ Taking into
consideration either the block of text transposed or the place at which a change

from the regular order occurs there seems to be, in certain places at least, a

close connection between OF and MG, CA and CD, LD and LE and ML,
CB and LD and LE. Eliminating LD, LE, ML, which differ from the
others in the place assigned to Dower, the position of De Actione Dotis is
unusual in OA, OF, MG, ΜΚ, CB, Β, W, allos which either omit it or put
it near the end of the book. LF stands apart by itself. Unfortunately that
is about all which this special set of facts, of and by themselves tells us. The
facts are clear enough, but the connection between them is not easily
discovered; the evidence as a whole is vague, it conveys hints rather than
actual information. To know that certain blocks of text have been treated as
entities in themselves by some of the copyists, to know that several manu-
scripts insert one or the other of these blocks of text at, or near, the end of the
book, is to know definitely very little except that in some of the codicesa
portion of the text has become misplaced. Nor is there much in these
particular manuscripts to incite a further investigation3 for the most part they
are, as has been said, not in the first rank. If it were a set of the better
codices which were under discussion there might be room for the suspicion that
the order in V was not the correct one, or at least that the portiom of text so
clearly marked off in one way or another in these copies represented blocks of
text likewise distinctly set apart in Bracton’s own codex. Under the circum·
stances such suspicions do not arise, for it would be difficult to believe that
the poorer manuscripts had kept intact the evidence ol original divisions when
these divisions had already been lost sight of in the better manuscripts. Yet
the facts in regard to the variation shown by these manuscripts have a value

¹ There can be no doubt that the position of Dower in V is the correct one. lt is easy to understand
how, when the treatise on Dower, having been copied out aa a quire by itselt, had been removed from ita proper
position in the book, it should have been inserted at f. 98, aster seven folios devoted to the subject of Dower.
But in this earlier part of the book the subject is really that of acquisition-how property may be acquired “ex
musa dotis’' aa is made plain by the opening words of Do Aetione Dotis. As a civil action it would naturally
corne in with the other civil actions. This is the probable reason why some os the MSS. have put it et the end
of the civil actions. Dower ia expressly mentioned by Bracton in that chapter which introduces the civil
actions, f. 100. ln his plan it could not have corne ester the Writ of Right, as some MSS. have it, for he
expresely states that his plan is to treet the Writ os Right last-⁴ ‘Placitum vero de recto ultimum sibi locum
vendicat in ordine placitorum,” etc„ f. 828.
