PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

on this subject as we' may be able to gather 100000 these other sources can he
understood clearly only in the light 01 11001 more direct evidence which comes
from an actual collation 01 1100 text.

There is no need to enumerate here the reasons which might make
(1001000100000001010001101100001 the text 01 011 1100 manuscripts when the
question 01 pedigree is under consideration. Most of them are sels-evident.
The very desire for thoroughness would justify such a collation. But in the
0000011100 Bracton manuscripts the task would be one 01 such proportions asto he
well-high impossible. When one thinks of the number of words in the nearly
nine hundred large pages 01 closely written and abbreviated Latin 01 1100 first
edition, and then 01 1100 more than forty manuscripts which would have 10 100
compared, the magnitude of the taslr becomes apparent. And even if time
and energy for such a work could be found, the result 0111 would be to furnish
an amount 01 material so bulky as to be unwieldy. This complete collation
being at least inexpedient, the question arises as to how extensive a one is
necessary. To some it may seem on first sight that the amount of collation-
text and variants-given below is excessive, and more than is necessary under
the circumstances. A consideration 01 1100 10010 will probably alter that
opinion. There have been collated twelve passages 01 various lengths aggre-
gating some nine folios out 01 0 10101 01 1000 hundred and forty-four in the
printed text, or an average 01 one folio in fifty. This certainly can not be
regarded as an undue amount. Ι1 anything, the amount 01 0011011000 errs in
being too little rather than too much; at least double the amount, the collation
of another twelve passages in chosen places, would be necessary 10 determine

the exact relationship of all parts 01 1100 text in those manuscripts which have ⁸

been copied by more than one hand. But for all practica] purposes the
collation which has been made is sufficient. While not solving all the
problema connected with the genealogy of the manuscripts, it is quite enough
to fumish us with a very fair estimate of their family relationship, and at the
same time allows us to judge 01 110010 respective merits and failings As a
result 01 11 we are able 10 pick out the better from the poorer copies, which is
all that is necessary at this time. The complete collation of these better and

representative manuscripts will ensue when the new text is made.

As to the choice of certain passages for collation-hundreds of similar
passages might have been chosen in other parts 01 1100 book—a word or two
may be said. It will he noticed that in nine cases (on fs. ab,5b,ac‚ 118,
18210, 17910, 25310, alab, 41110) 1100 portions of text chosen are rather short.
