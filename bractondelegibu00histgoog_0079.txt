PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

. where that of warranty ends.¹ That Bracton meant to treat of exceptions asa

separate title becomes evident as early as f. areb, from a passage in which he
gives his reasons for so doing. “Cum autem onerosum esset de singulis excep-
tionibus tractare suo loco et perse, utilius et facilius erit, ut videtur, omnes
quasi in unum fasciculum colligere et de omnibus simul tractare per ordinem.
Ideo omisso hic tractatu de exceptionibus, tractetur de visu petendo ..... ”
That it is not going to be a treatise wholly independent by itself, but rather
one of the minor treatises under De Recto, would appear from the words with
which the writer tums from Warranty to the new subject.⁹ It will be noticed
that its reference to the day of summons aster delays and essoins connect this
passage with chapter five on f. arab, the place at which the subject of defaults
ends and the discussion of how the claimant ought to propound his declaration
begins. And it is this latter topic whose treatment is followed immediately
by the author's statement that he is going to pass by exceptions for the
present and take up the consideration of “de visu petendo.'’ This is the point
to which Bracton's mind would revert when he started to write about
exceptions. For it is probable that instead of regarding this as a new subject
he looked at it rather as another side of an old subject, that of procedure. His
one object was to give a clear exposition of what would happen, or might
happen‚ when the actual case introduced by a Writ of Right came before the
court. Like many another subject in the Dc Legibus, Exceptions begins with
a definition as to what it is.⁸ In the last section of the first chapter is
introduced the topic of exceptions which may be raised against jurisdiction‚⁴
and this subject is continued from this point through chapter sixteen! Chapter
seventeen then takes up the question of exceptions against the writ.⁸ In one
form or another the subject of exceptions goes on to f. 489 and the personal
actions.

Ι ¹Seeabove‚ p. 31. Cf. f. 819ss—“ut infrade exceptionibus plenius.” References of this sort to the
special treatment of exceptions are fairly frequentin the civil actions.

² F. asab-⁸ ‘Ad diem summonitiouis post dilationes et essonia revertamur, ad quam cunr partes compar·
nerint si non habeat tenens warrantum quem vocare potest, vel se habuerit et nullum vocat, proposita in
iudicio coram iusticiariis ut praedictum est intentione petentis, . ...ad elidendam actionem proponat teneus
exceptionem si quam habuerit, et illam probet, et doceat quod exceptio ad illum pertineat, secundum quod
dicitnr ductionibus, et eodem modo. Exceptiones eninr loco actionum sunt.”

⁸ F. 399b—“lnprimis videndum quid sit exceptio et qualiter dividatur.”

⁴1³. roob-“item inprimis dieatur de una illarum quas generalia estad omnes actiones, scilicet de illa
quae apponitur contra iurisdictionem.”

⁸ A slight change of subject comes at esp. liv-“Dictum est snpra de exceptionibus quae oompetnut
contra iurisdictionem. Nunc videndum si sit aliqua quse competere possit contra personam iustician'i.”

⁸ 1³. ars-“confirmata sic iurisdictione iudicis, consequenter audiatur breve per quod expediri et exponi
debet.”
