ABRANGEMENT OF THE MANuscml'rs BY GBOUPS

By the collation of these twelve passages certain facts are made evident
at the very first glance. It is seen that there are almost innumerable
differences of reading in the many manuscripts. That such an amount of
variation should have developed is all the more remarkable because of the
comparatively short period during which the manuscripts were produced;
even texts which come from the third or fourth generation of copies show
very considerable differences. Some of the texts deviate from the correct
reading more osten and more radically than others in the same line or the
same generation. Some are so consisteutly at varianoe with what the
majority of the better copies in all lines regard as right and proper that it at
once becomes evident that they are textually of little worth. Just what the
relative text value of the better manuscripts is may not be so apparent, but it
ean be determined. And it is not out of place to point out that even if the
pedigree of the manuscripts could have been discovered by some other and
less involved method, the collation of considerable portions of the text would
yet have been necessary, since only by such acollation is it possible to form
an estimate of the relative goodness or badness of each copy from the stand-
point ofa correct text. That the manuscripts naturally fall into certain more
or less well-defined groups is also readily seen, especially as regards the longer
of the collated passages. Itis plain, too, that in several instances there is an
agreement by pairs, though it would require more of an examinatior to
discover that the pair grouping is not the same for each passage.

The full significance of the evidence furnished by the collation can,
however, be understood only alter a detailed study. But it is asking too
much of the reader to require him to work over this mass of miscellaneous
material, with many of its important facts half hidden, and arrange its details
