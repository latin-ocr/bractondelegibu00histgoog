PEDlGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

The three manuscripts OM, HA, W, which more than once occur in the
same combination, are each of uneven value. In some places they are good and
in other places poor. Their general value is impaired because it is difficult to tell
where “good” leaves off and “bad’' begins. The use of such manuscripts as
these will hardly be necessary except in those comparatively few cases where it
becomes desirable to get every possible reading for a very important and much
disputed passage. lf in the process of collating the more representative texts
in groups (1), (ΙΙ), (ΙΙΙ), it is found that the manuscripts in (IV) and those at
times associated with thern have a tradition and importance of their own which
the work thus far done has not made apparent, OM, HA, W, may take to
themselves a value which can not rightly be granted to them at present.

Those manuscripts which have not been specifically mentioned have been
passed over either because there are better texts in the same line, or because
they are distinctly poor, as a glance at the tabulated number of variants will
show. Though from time to time some special reason may make it expedient
to compare one or another of them in this or that place, there is uo likelihood
that they will ever have to be consulted at great length. This is true even of

Ι ΜΕ and ΜΗ, ΜΚ and X, CA, which manuscripts-as CC also under certain
conditions—would be of considerable assistance in determining the traditional

readings of (ΙΙ) if their texts were more trustworthy.
