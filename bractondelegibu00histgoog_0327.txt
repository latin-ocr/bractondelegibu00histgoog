PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPI'S

in view of the lack of agreement between these two groups elsewhere at this
place, maist be regarded as the result either of a coincidence or 01 1 correction
made from one line to the other. Y and MF also belong in (1), with MF
apparently nearer to P than to Y. CF and LT form a closely related pair
group which stands somewhat apart from the other members of (Ι). We may
express the broader lines of relationship in (Ι) thus :¹

In (ΙΙ) OF, OM, MG, ΜΗ, ΜΚ, CB, CM, LB, HA, ΗΒ, Β, all belong

in one large group, with the pair group OF, MG, occupying a position between
the subgroups MH, CM, LB‚ OM, HA, and CB, ΗΒ, Β. ΟΜ and HA are
manifestly nearer to one another than to either MH or LB, having had the
same parent or grandparent. CB and B had a common ancestor some two or
three generations back, while ΗΒ was copied from either CB or a descendant
01 CB. MH and CM are closely related. MK, the poorest manuscript in

the whole group, 1111 in a niche by itself. The connection between MK and
X has been noticed already. ΜΙ, LC, LD, CA, form a group distinct from

that in which OF, MG, OM, MH, etc, are found, with CA agreeing less .

¹lt is realiaed that the following ligures can 1101 110 altogether satisfactory. Naturally they can not
be 111010 exact than the facts, which are not at all complete. Α11110 most they ean 11111 represent 1110 trend 01

01 MSS. 01011 passage will need to be treated independently 01 every other, but an effort will be made to keep
1110 diagrams as near alike as possible, in order to facilitate 1110 drawing 01 1 single ligure oi 111010 general
