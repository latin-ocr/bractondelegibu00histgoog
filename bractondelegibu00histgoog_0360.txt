BRACPON: DE LEGIBUS

Fs. ab, 5b-MM is lacking. OM, HA, W, ME, CC, P, come together
in a large subgroup which splits up into (OM, HA, W), (OM, ΗΑ), (ΜΕ,
ΟΟ, P). The pair group MH, CM, arenear them in (ΙΙ). (CF, LT), LC,

ΜΕ, are in (Ι). The general relationship of these manuscripts in this passage
has been discussed above (pp. 264-266).

Ε. 96-ΜΜ is lacking. In (Ι) are ΜΕ, ΕΟ, and the pair group HA,
OM. CF, LT, have gone over to (ΙΙΙ), Most of the members of (IV) are
now in (ΙΙ); ME, ΜΗ, CM, P, with Β, forming one combination, of which
ME, MH, CM, make yet a smaller group. CC and LB make up another pair
group. The position of ΟΕ, W, which are closely related to one another, is
not altogether determinable. These two manuscripts may belong nearer to

OM, HA.

Fs. 118, raas-Mn, MM, lacking. HA and OM lack the first of these
passages. (ΟΕ, ΕΤ), ΕΟ, are in (Ι), and MH, CM, LB,-(MH, ΟΜ) is a
pair group-in (ΙΙ) for both passages. ME, CC, P, W,-(ME, W), (ΟΟ,
Pl—are probably in (ΙΙ) for the first passage. W is very mixed in its agree-
ments, as already noticed on p. 271.

Ε. nan-MM, lacking. ΜΙ, ΕΟ, ΟΜ, are a suhgroup in (Ι). (ΟΜ,
ΗΑ), W, possibly belong in the same large division. (ΜΕ, P), are probably
in (ΙΙΙ). In (ΙΙ) is the combination ΜΕ, ΜΗ, ΟΟ, ΕΒ, ΟΕ, ΕΤ, which
splits up into (ΜΕ, ΜΗ, ΟΟ, ΕΒ), (ΜΕ, ΜΗ), (ΟΟ, ΕΒ), (ΟΕ, ΕΤ).
There should be taken into consideration the combination (ΜΕ, ΜΗ, ΟΕ,
ΕΤ), ΙΟΑ, ΕΙ), X, found in the text proper and in the addicto as well.
The subgroup OM, HA, W, occurs in the addicto.

F. 253h-M M, CF, LT, are lacking. Itis not apparent to which of the
larger groups they belong, but the following sub-groups occur: (ΜΕ, ΟΟ,
ΜΙ, ΕΒ), (ΜΗ, ΟΜ), (ΟΜ, W). Two variants of special significance are
tanti redditas (tanto redditu), OM, W, MH, CM, LC, P; and the omission ’
of et ai obita. . . . r'n Anglium, OM, W, MH, CM. ’

Ε. aran-The pair groups CC, LB, and LD, W, are found in (ΙΙ).
ΟΜ may perhaps go with W in a group OM, ΜΕ, W. P forms a combina-
tion with ME, MH, ΟΜ, the last two making a pair group, as osten in other
places Their position here is not made evident. As noted on p. 276, ΟΕ,
ΕΤ, here, as elsewhere, a pair group, are put in association with the ME, MH,
CM, P, group by a single variant. So also is OM. The position of ΕΟ is
not certain. It agrees with (Ι) in having non for numnquam, but it has ibi for
in with P, CM. It does not show its usual agreement with ΜΙ for a pair
