PREFAOE

Sir Frederick Pollock for many courtesies which have aided my work at
Lincoln's Inn and elsewhere. Mr. Hubert I-Iall has my thanks for the
genereus help he has given me on more than one occasion.

To him to whom this book ia dedicated Ι vender my truest thanks for a
never wavering interest that has always found time to consider any question
connected with the work To other of my associates in the Univemity 1
would express my appreciation for many belpful suggestions.

My sincere thanks are due to the Yale Univensity Press, and especially to
its Director, Mr. Ε. Byrne Hackett, for having relieved me from all care in
the actual making of this book. The printer has done well a piece of work
which was in many places far from easy. His proof-reaaeler has my grateful
thanks for a painstaking esrefulnoes which has corrected many a slip of my
own.

Ι should aelmowledge the good work of the Oxford University Press, of
Mr. R. B. Fleming of Hmow, and of Mr. W. F. Dunn of the Cambridge
University Library, which by reprodueing for me entire ten manuscripts and
larger or smaller portions of twenty-eight others has made it possible for me to
study Bructon's text at first hand on this side of the Atlmtic,

This work is yet far from completiom it will be many years before it is
finished. In the meanwhile, new manuscripts of Bracton may be discovered in
hitherto unsuspected places. It would be areal help if those who may become
cognizant of the whereabouts of such manuscripts should inform me of them.
It is my hope, too, that information relative to Braemn or to Bracton's text
may come to me otherwise than merely through the medium of book reviews.

Lastly, ns befltting its importance in connection with the work, it should
be said that the publication of this edition has been made possible through the
generosity of the late Mr. John E. Par-sons, of New York‚ whose interest in
the work and in Yale led him to establish a University fund for that purpose.
