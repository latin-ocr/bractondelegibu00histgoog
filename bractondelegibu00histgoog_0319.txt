PEDIGBEE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

same place? Both of these questions will shortly be taken up, and it will
then be seen that the lack of intermediate connections in each 0000 makes the
answer largely a matter of guesswork.

Again, many of the manuscripts follow one line of descent in one part of
their text and quite a different line, or 11000, 10 other parts. Some that were
copied by more than one scribe even go sofar as to follow a different text
tradition with every change of penmanship. Yet it is not necessary that the
manuscript should be written in several hands in order to show divergences
from a single line. One written in six or eight different hands, from as many
originals, might be copied entire by a single scribe, in which 0000 011 external
signs of its many-sided origin would be lost. So many of the manuscripts
come from more than one source that we can not be sure of the relationship
of any one of them except for those parts which have been collated. There is
every reason for believing that those which like OB and LG, CF and LT,
agree closely in every place at which they are compared, agree throughout.
It may be taken for granted, also, that those which consistently fall into the
same family groups, and show the same family truita, in each passage which
has been collated, continue throughout in the same family line. But, from
the standpoint of one who is trying to establish an orderly and detailed
pedigree‚ instances of such continued agreement are all too few, and more
than offset by the constantly recurring contradictory agreements. To take a
case in point. In the collation on 1. ab, ΟΕ 10 found to agree with the OB
group, and OM with HA. In the collation 01 the passage on f. 96, ΟΕ
clearly shows itself to be related to W. On f. 118, ΟΕ goes with Ml and
LC, which pair off 10 many of the collated passages. By the time fs. 161-1621)
are reached, W is in combination with OM and HA instead of with OE. In
the collation for fs. hlaslsb OM is found in a group with ME, MH, B; W
pairs with LC, the latter having become detached from MI, which remains in
the OB group3 HA follows the larger OB group rather than any other. It
should be noticed that all this change really centers about the varying
relationships 01 only three or four manuscripts OE, ΟΜ, W, HA. The great
difficulty lies in finding out just what change has taken place. Does ΟΕ leave
the W tradition, or vice versa? Does OM go over to the side of W, or W to
OM? Why do HA and OM separate? A collation of the entire text would
probably answer these questions satisfactorily3 when the answer depends upon
such facts as may be found in a few short passages, it must at times be far
from convincing. It might be expected that in this particular case the
