BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

of the book that it became necessary to make memoranda 01 100 facts.1 It is
quite possible that the sending away 01 10000 quires written by hand IV 101
100 purpose 01 recopying, or even for some other reason, may have produced
the irregularities in the other manuscripts. Whatever may be the true
explanation of the variation from the normal order in these copies, it is certain
that the ultimate cause 01 11 10 10 00 found in the fact that at least some 01 100
00100000 quires 01 OA were recopied before being put together in an orderly
volume.e This being 00, 100 thing which immediately suggests itself as a
solution 01100 01001010 10 0001101100 01 these particular quires 01 ΟΑ with the
corresponding parts 01 100 01001 manuscripts concerned. But a collation 01
100 manuscripts affected in those portions of the text which are out 01 10011
customary 01000, would not necessarily solve the difficulty. To get results
which would prove at all convincing it would 00 necessary to collate not only
the manuscripts which have the unusual order, 001 011 100 010010 100. Αο0
even in that case the value 01 0 001101100 would be vitiated by the many
omissions in the manuscripts most directly concerned. ML, CF, LA, LT,
which omit the equivalent of quire Q 01 OA, could not be compared with the
Digby manuscript at this important place. Since ΟΑ 110011 omitsthe 11001100
00 Dower, no amount 01 0011111100 will ever make it possible forus to ascertain
whether 01 001 100 manuscripts which put this portion 01 100 text out 01 110
’ 00001 place have derived De Actione Dotis from the same source as the
probably lost quire 01 ΟΑ 00 1010 subject. The collation of fs. 3190320,
which comes only two folios aiter the end 01 1)οο01, shows that most 01 100
01001 manuscripts which omit or misplace this subject do not agree closely
with OA at this point, though they do agree more or less among themselves.
'Phe 001101100101 1. 96 0000 001 show those manuscripts which transpose
10. 62098 (ML, CB, LD, LE) in anything like the close agreement with
Digby 222 which inevitably would result if they had been copied directly from
its quires F and G. But it is not at all necessary to suppose that the manu-
scripts which make a change in the regular order 01 subjects were themselves
directly copied from OA, or even from exemplars which had been so derived.
They may be several generations manuscript generations, later, and perhaps
only indirectly affected. In many 01 100 cases the effects may have been
