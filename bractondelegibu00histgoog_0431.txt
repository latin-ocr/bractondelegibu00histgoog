THE ADDICIONES

margin. But in none of these manuscripts do the places where changes occur
coincide with the breaks in (Ι), CE, Y. When f. 45 is reached (Ι), CE, Y,
make a sudden change which the other manuscripts do not follow. From this
point on through f. 151 they have, with one or two exceptions, the additional
passages in the main text, agreeing in this with the manuscripts generally.
Inasmuch as this block of text takes in portions from three different hands in
OA, two of which have marginal addicientes, and one of which does not, that
manuscript either omits or has in the margin. LA is similar to OA in this
respect, though the two manuscripts do not agree on either the marginal
passages or the omissions. OC omits a fisth part of the passages—within a
space of thirty folioS, however, so that its omissions are not at all general. OD
is once ¹marginal; MC and ML omit once or twice. But it is only OA and
LA that regularly omit the additiones from their main text for this portion of
the treatise. Between fs. 152 and 182 this same statement holds true for the
most part, though LA now and then has an addicto in the text. But ΟΕ and
Y do not follow (Ι) as faithfully as for fs. 45-151. Not only do these two
manuscripts several times omit passages found in (Ι), but the latter group in
turn refuses to receive addidoawa which find a place in ΟΕ. For fs. 183-198
CE and Y regularly omit, and for a good two-thirds of the passages (Ι) agrees
with them. OA is marginal throughout; LA is marginal for fs. laub-laab,
but from that point till f. 206 is reached gives the passages in the main text or
omits thern altogether. Fs. auo-444 do not need to be discussed in detail at
this time. If the whole body of addicimus is looked over it will be seen that
the manuscripts which may be regarded as in any large measure omitting
these passages in their main texts-in contrast to those manuscripts which
generally give them—are 0A, LA, ΟΕ, Y, (Ι). Just at present we are more
directly concerned with (Ι). How did it corne about that for over one
hundred folios of the printed text this group has incorporated all the
addicimur?

Fortunately, the attempted answer to that question does not have to be
made entirely on the basis of the information to be derived from the presence
or absence in the texts of the addicim themselves. Something more has
been learned from the collation and comparison of the texts. And such
knowledge as has been acquired makes it at once evident that the only
explanation which will account for the incorporated addictam in (Ι) on
fs. 45-151 is either that this portion of the treatise had been thoroughly
worked over by Bracton before (Ι) split off as a side line, or that some common
