THE MANUSCRIPTS

Including those which are fragmentary, abridged, or incompleta-:there
are forty·six manuscripts of Bracton’s treatise accessible to scholam, with-two,
possibly three, others in existence which are not accessible.¹ All of these‘are

¹ written on vellum, varying greatly in size of sheet and quality ofmateria13'J’·’‘.··‚
mostly in late thirteenth or early fourteenth century hands of different styles
and types. Some have been carefully and neatly written, while others show
very evident signs of hoste and negligence. In many of the copies the capital
letters at the beginning of titles or paragraphs have been worked out in colors,

ἱ in some cases omamented capitals in gold and colors mark the more prominent
points of division, but the majority are exceedingly plain in appearance, and
in some even the rubrics are written in black ink. In these, as in other
manuscripts of the same period, dragous, centaurS, and monsters of many

· shapes aud sorts, illustrate the love of the medieval mind for the grotesque;
but there is nothing of the illumination and wealth of decoration found in the
books of a slightly later time. Very few of these Bracton manuscripts are

, complete. Not only are large portions at the beginning or end frequently

⁴ ' lacking, but there are osten folios or quires missing from other parts, or exten·
sive gaps in the text itself.' On the other hand, not a few of the texts contain
extraneous matter of considerable extent-little treatises like those on consan-
guinity or affinity, references to or commenta on the statutes of Henry III
and Edward Ι, glosseS‚ aud notes of various kinds. Usually the De Legibus
occupies a volume by itself, but in several instanccs it forms only part of a
volume made up of very diversified contents. of abbreviated Bracton texts
there are several different typeS, some of them omitting only the cases, or the
cases and writs, others being the results of deliberate attempts to cut down
the rather lengthy treatisc, which at times must have proved cumbersome, as

¹ of the live Bractou MSS. formerly iu the Phillipps Library at Cheltenham only one remulus, aud that
is rendered practically inaccessible by the prohibitive foe of a guiuea a day charged sor consultius it. Three

others ara now iu librarios which geuerously place them at the disposal of scholare. (See ΗΑ, ΗΒ, CM, below.)
The other has disappearcd, presumably into some private collection. Thera may also bo a Bracton MS. at

Stamford court, worcestershire. See below, p. 90.

¹ Due, iu all probability, to the loss of peges or quires iu tho exemplar. Notice a case of this in OB aa
descnbed below.
