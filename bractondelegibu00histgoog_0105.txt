PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

similar references of a later period have to the later copies. Full of interest
and information as bearing on this subject is a set of marginalia to be found
in HA. They come from the generation following Bracton. With possibly
one exception they have been written by one who seems to have been the
owner of the book, and who, in a fine bold charter hand, has made such
corrections and annotations as would denote a use of the text. Two have
been scribbled‚ and two have been scrawled in lead, but, apparently, by the
same hand. They are in the margins, and have not been treated as rubrics,
showing that they were not in the exemplar of HA.¹ We give them in the
order in which they come: “Nota pro secta de Morleghe,'’ “Nota pro
Morleghe,’‘ “Nota pro H. fil. Alani‚‘’ “Nota pro P. de Fyssacre apud
Lyndewichetone,” “N ota pro Eustochio le barun et aliis talibus,” “Nota pro
P. de Fyssacre contra dominum J ohannem de Welygtone,” “Nota pro P. de
Fyssacre pro Stoke,‘' “Nota pro P. de Fyssacre in Morleghe,'’ “Nota contra
opinionem Andree de Treloske‚” “Nota pro molend. de Wychenow,“ “N ota
pro Ade de Hacche.” These are scattered over, approximately, the first half
of the book. Nearer the end (on f. 882 of the printed text) is “N ota pro
domina Ysobella de Fyssacre.” In lead are “N ota contra Andr. de Tre-
loske,” and “Nota contra Andr.‘’ Here is a typical, though rather numerous,
set of this sort of annotations. It is quite evident that certain cases made a
deep impression on the mind of the annotator, who kept referring to thern in
much the same way that the annotator of the Note Book kept bringing
in the allusion to Corbio. What might be made out of this list of names if
the rolls were consulted, supposing the rolls to exist, we can not say. But
what we may learn, very easily, is that these references, like those of the earlier
set, have to do with Bracton's own county of Devonshire. In Feudol Aius,

Ι under Devon, and the hundred of Stanburgh, for 1284-86, we find the entry,

“Adam de Hache tenet Hache pro quarta parte,” etc.² On the next page is a
similar entry to the effect that “Petrus de Fisacre tenet morlegh pro un. f.

¹ Margimlia of tbis sort in au exemplar would be almost sure to become rubrica in the copy, or at least
be copied in the red ink of tbe rubricator. A very good example of this ia to be seen in ΗΒ. Writteu in the
side margins, or at the bottom of the pagos with marks in the side margins denoting the passages to which they
refer, in red inlr, are tbe following: “Nota casum filii domini Rogeri ln Warre et Hauwysote,’' “Nota contra
sororem Roberti de la Chamber apud Alvech,'' “Nota Cokton,” “Nota Wicheford,” “Nota contra testm.
llaldwinide Frevylla de Walton,” “Nota Cokton.” On the other hand, tbe word addicto, which is used
several times iu both HA and ΗΒ to mark some of the additional passages, is written in red ink in tbe former
MS. and in blaclr inlr in the latter, showing that these additiones were in HA’s exemplar-either in blaelr or
red-and that they were inserted in ΗΒ aster the MS. was written.
