BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

presuppose, or prove, an immediate common ancestry. In the addicto there is
noticeable a more pronounced connection between OM, HA, W, and here
these texts follow (ΙΙΙ) rather than (Ι), as most of the members of the latter
group omit the additional passage. There is also the suggestion ofa connec-
tion between OG and W, but this might not be borne out by a more extensive
collation. In OG this passage is in the second portion of the codex, that por·
tion in which OG was found to agree with Y for the passage on fs. 161-162b.
OG and Y form a pair group at this place. We are justified in keeping
both of these manuscripts in (ΙΙΙ), for while they follow (Ι) in the two non·
determinative variants already noticed, they do not show a tendency to go with
this group in a more general way. In some of their readings, more especially
in the additio, they agree with (ΙΙ) or (ΙΙΙ). Υ has not changed its hand since
fs. lor-loab, nor is there anything to suggest that it has changed its tradition.
The agreement of OM with the larger OF group in reading dictorum for
dicti may be the result of copying a corrected exemplar. Considered in its
entirety the evidence in regard to OM, HA, W, is contradictory. For want
of fuller information we may tentatively place these three manuscripts as on
fs. tol-loab, which will permit group (Ι) to be represented as for these
earlier folios.

In (ΙΙ) the largest distinct group is OF, MG, ΜΚ, CC, LB, X, ΜΕ, ΜΗ,
CF, LT, but there is no question that CA, X, LD, CB, B, ΗΒ, should be
added to these to form a larger combination. The sub-groups which appear
are (ΜΕ, ΜΗ, CF, LT), (ME, ΜΗ, CC, ΕΒ), (ΜΕ, ΜΗ), (CF, LT), (CC,
ΕΒ), (OF, MC), (CA, Χ). CB, ΗΒ, Β, probably constitute another group,
with CB and ΗΒ in their usual pair relationship. OC is found in agreement
with both (ΙΙ) and (ΙΙΙ), though not decidedly with either. There is no reason
for changing its position as given for fs. lot-loab. The connection between
OC and MD, which has been remarked upon frequently, is made evident again
here, both of these manuscripts reading against all others qualitatem for
quantitatem. A question which the collation raises, but does not answer, is
that of the exact position of CF, LT, ΜΕ, ΜΗ, CA, X, within the group
itself. lt would seem that there had been a slight change in the actual
positions occupied by at least the first four of these manuscripts. This
impression might he changed by further collation; and it is perfectly certain,
as far as the whole number of manuscripts is concerned, that the relative
positions of these particular texts have not altered. The single agreement of
MK and X against all others—atram forastrum calleat—carries little or no
