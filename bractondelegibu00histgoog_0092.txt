BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

estimating, of course, within reasonable limits the approximate number of
folios or quires which would be produced from a certain block of text-and let

them finish where they might. This would result in new quires starting new -

subjects, and in empty parchment at the end of different hands for only very
seldom, if ever, would the scribe just fill au even quire or number of quires
with the amount of copy allotted to him.¹ In other wordS, OA could have
been produced in its present shape by six penmen copying from several
Α different exemplars. We will even go one step further and say that OA as it
now stands might have resulted from its six writers having made use of a
single manuscript divided among them, said manuscript being neither the
original copy once in Bracton’s own handS, nor having a single new
subject begin on any new quire, nor a single column of blank parch-
ment at the end of any one of those quires. The points at which in
OA one hand finishes one subject and another hand takes up another
subject might have come at the beginning, middle, or end, of any page, folio,
or quire, in this model. Indeed, it is hardly correct to put these last statements
in the form of asupposition‚ for there are certain peculiarities in the order in
which the various scribes have written OA which suggest strongly that a
single exemplar of the ordinary type formed the model for at least a
considerable part of the Digby manuscript.3 Under ordinary circumstances

a single copy which was to be reproduced by several scribes working at the same
time would naturally be taken apart and distributed by quires or folios to each of ’
the penmen. But the portions allotted to any one copyist would in all probability
be consecutive, forthere would be usually uo more expedient method of
allotment. In a manuscript copied under these conditions we should be apt to

find vacant spaces of parchment at the end of each scribe’s work, but not new
subjects beginning with new hands, as the exemplar would probably not admit
of such a division. Now some unusual set of circumstances might cause the
apportionment of material to the scribes to be made in another way. Suppose,

² ln regard to tbe amount os space which a certain portion ol text might occupy, the work ol the average
scribe was osten uueveu. Cbaugea in pen, ink, or vellum, made declded differencea iu¹ the amount ol copy
which could be, or rather would be, reproduced upon a given number oi lolios. Variation iu sires of the lettera
and in the siae ot the space used for writing would make oue quire oonuin more or less thau another. Quires
J, K, L, M, N, in ΟΛ are each of eight folios and written by the same haud. They contain respectivaly aome
29, 19, 18, 20, 18 lolius of tbe printed text.

’Rathercouclusive evidence that tbe important quire R was aot copied from the same exemplar aa tbe
quire which precedes it is found in the ending ol Q and the beginning ol R-“de morte aliorum praemortu-
orum ΙΙ postmortuorum ut videri” where the reading should be “de morte aliorum praemortuorum ut videri.”
The scribent Q (band V) would hardly bave copied an extra word merely ior tbe sake of lilling up a line, aa
pronon cornea at tbe eud ot oue line and onan runs over into tbe waning of another, which except for this
is lest blank with the rest ol the page.
