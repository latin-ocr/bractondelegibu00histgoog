PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

length-and it is evident that in each case the intention is to mark the point
at which the treatment of warranty ends and a new subject begins. Aa will
be shown below,l this new subject is that of exceptions, but because chapter
two takes up the consideration of exceptione which may be raised against
jurisdictions, and because a general discussion of jurisdiction continues
through chapter sixteen, OA, OB, etc, would start their fifth book with the
title Dc iurisdictionibus instead of DeEcceptionibus. An even greater variety
of choice is offered earlier in the treatise. There seems to have been a feeling
on the part of those who were making the different schemes of division that
a break should ocem at the point where Bracton turns from the discussion of
actions in general to the more limited and specific topic of criminal actions in
English courts. The printed book puts this point at f. 115b3 the manu·
scripts variously choose f. 107, 118, or 120. Such confusion hardly settles
anything definitely.

As far as there is any general division into books we have two principal
schemeS, that of V, and the one followed by OA, OB, etc. Each has been
laid out on the basis of a division of subjecta. 'lhat of V is perhaps the more
obvious; even a very rapid glaucing over of the text will show what it ia.
The other scheme has been outlined in the rubrics of some of the manuscripts
which have been preserved. All of these manuscripts belong to the same
family3 somewhere back in their line of descent they had a common ancestor
with these long rubrics at the beginning of the books' Numerically con-
sidered, therefore, they should count as one instead of many, since they
represent a single head. 'l'he fact that, by chance, a large number of descend-
ants of this progenitor have corne down to us, does not make that particular
codex count for any more thau the head of another line whose progeny have
disappeared. For the present the important thing about these manuscripts is
not their number, but these unusual rubrica For purposes of comparison we
will give with these rubrics those lines in the text of V which have determined
its division.

At the beginning of book two (f. 8b) V has, “Dictum est supra de
rerum divisione, nunc autem dicendum est qualiter dominia rerum acquiruntur,
de iure naturali sive gentium. ” Preceding its second book (f. 107 of V) OE

¹ See below, p. 69.

² 'lheae MSS. are OB, OE, MA, MD, Ml, LG. Not all of the rubrica are found in each MS. MA and
MD are the least closely connected with the others. ΟΕ, which ia written in more than one band, agrees with

more chunone line, but principally with thia. ln OB and LG large portione of vacant space, in addition to the
rubrica, precede the new booka.
