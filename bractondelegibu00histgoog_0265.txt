PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPIS

for himself. So it has seemed best to present those facts which have a direct
bearing upon the question of pedigree in a form which is both more orderly
and more discemible. In making this arrangement by groups, the object has
been to work from the larger to the smaller. First of all are given those
largest combinatione of manuscripts—osten at variance with one another-
which center about a single variant, such, ior instance, as are determined by
the readings of ergo audentem at the very beginning of the passage on f. ab.
Following these have been placed the larger of the regular groups, which are
divided into smaller sub-groups, and, whenever possible, into pairs. Thus in
the collation for fs. 113-4151), the large group OB, OD, MA, ΜΒ, MD, MF,
ΜΙ, MN, LF, LG, Y, breaks up into the groups (OB, OD, MF, LG, LF),
(OB, LF, LG), (OD, ΜΡ), (MA, MD), with ΜΒ, ΜΙ, ΜΝ, Y, showinga
less clearly defined relationship. Alter these regular groups are usually given
a number ο1 more or less irregular combinations which do not readily adjust
themselves to the group arrangement.

Variants collected under each group heading are not specifically numbered
as to folio and line. However, as even the longer of the collated passages
are, aster all, but short ones, and as the entries are made in the order in which
they occur in the collation, any one who so desires will have no difficulty in
checking up the variants assigned to each group. When a minus sign
precedes the notation of a manuscript within a parenthesis, as (-MN), it
means that this manuscript does not agree with the other manuscripts in the
group at this particular place. A plus sign used in the same way (÷M1v)
signifies that the manuscript should be added to the list of those which have
the variant.
