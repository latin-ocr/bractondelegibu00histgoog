BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

of the same copy did not make use of the same exemplar. This fact is not
hard to explain. A man might have borrowed several volumes from friends,
and set to work at once as many copyists as they would supply-in a scrip
torium, perhaps, or elsewhere¹ If scribes many miles apert were working
at the same time on a new codex they would naturally use different
exemplars. The transition from one hand to another is at times so marked
as to suggest that considerable time had elapsed aster one copyist had
iinished his work before the other began. In the interval the unlinished book
may have changed owners and been carried far away from the place of its
inception, so that the very circumstances of difference in ¹time and place
may have forced the second writer to have used a model quite different from
that of the first.⁹ On the other hand, there may well have been instances in
which many hands copied out a new book from one original, as in the
easily supposed case of a monastery where various monks took turns at
reproducing a Bracton belonging to the library. MN is perhaps a manu·
script of this sort, four of its six hands being collated in the passages
below, and all belonging to the same line. ln order to be certain of the exact
relationship of all the different hands in every manuscript it would be neces·
sary to collate portions of them with corresponding parts in every other
manuscript, a task of such proportions as to be practically coextensive with a
complete collation of the whole treatise. And this, of course, is out of the
question. Moreover‚ the main facts in the situation are clearly enough shown
in the collation here given. Itis only necessary to add that this practice of
copying and recopying from more than one exemplar began early and lasted
late, and has produced a complicated network of lines of descent which it is
almost impossible to straighten out.

² We have recorda of the loaning oi Bracton MSS. See in regard to the loan oi a Bracton (lor several
months) made by Robert Burnell‚ Lord Chaucellor, in lati, selden, Diu. od Platoni, ll. 9. See also Broctors
aad Azo (Seld. Soc. vll), alo.

² MS. Y offers a ease in point. The llrst scribe ended his work with tomara misericordia wnrpmaioaa'a sat
(near the very end oi f. 1ovb of V) in a broken line about four-lisths oi the way down the llrst column of p. 143.
The second scribe began at the point where the llrst leit off and wrote through mio s’a brevi ds dignitato
(f. mab, isa oi V), completing the first column on page 966. Copyist number three linished the book from
this place on, besides writing most oi the rubrica. But the work of the iirst scribe had boen done so long
before that of the third that two iolios in the first hand bad already been lost, so that the last scribe was forced
to rewrite the first folio in the book and that which now is paged as 119‚120. Each of the hands follows a
different text tradition, and there is every indication of a lack of any preconcerted arrangement between the
scribes. Everything points to tha probability of the third scribe having been deliberately set to work to round
out and complete a fragmentary portion oi the Da maim on which two scribes had already worked at different
times. Itis possible that the work may have bean done for Walter de Stapelton, bishop of llxeten whose
