PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

would seem, was a deliberate attempt on the part of a number of copyists to
make what each, of his own jndgment and uninfluenced by the others,
considered an improvement on the text from which he was copying. And
here again the variants are non-determinative, being the results ofa coinci-
dence.¹ Earlier on this same f. 162 the confusion naturally arising from the
repetition of what is nearly the same word in the passage. . . . sine melantia,
et violenta sinc aranas, et violenta. . . . has resulted in the almost inevitable
exchange of violantia for violenta by some of the copyists. Variants produced
under these conditions can not be regarded as decisive in determining relation-
ship. In the same catagory comes the omission of et between coordinate
words—either with or without the insertion of a comma—as in the case of the
vino, oleo (vino et oleo) on f. 180. There should be included also the variants
which are due to the scribe following certain set expressions—independently of
his model-in formulas and phrases that have become more or less stereotyped,
as where for the usual anno regis· Hemici some scribes invariably‚ or almost
always write anno regni regis Hennaea In this same general group belong

· those variants which result from the joining together of different words or the ·

separating of a single word. These mistakes might be made by any scribe at
any time, being due largely to the fact that the spacing of words and letters
was osten far frorn uniform. Thus re aliter (for re dicad becomes realiter-,³ liber
erat shortens to liberat,·⁴ nationes changes to natione scilicet;⁶ iure may easily be
read for in re; and we even lind ei obesse turning to esse.⁶

All these non-determinative variants whatever their cause, must be
considered quite apart from those of a more conclusive character when the
collation is being studied for evidence which will determine the pedigree' of
the manuscripts. This fact should be emphasized as we pass to adiscussion
of the abbreviatione, sor much of what has already been said in regard to
variants in general applies with at least equal force to them. of the total
