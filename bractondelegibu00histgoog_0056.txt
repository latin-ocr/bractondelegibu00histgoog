BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

Tmn once more to the place where OA, OB, ete, begin their second
book, f. 107. Chapter eight ends with the statement that there is a great
difference between the sacerdotium and the regnam. “But’' says Bracton
at the very start of his next chapter, “since nothing in regard to the
regulation of the priesthood has to do with this treatise, therefore we must
consider those things which pertain to the kingdom.'’ To what does ad
tractatam tatum here refer? Is it to the work as a whole, or to this particular
treatise on Actions? The word itself will not tell us, because from Bracton's
use of it elsewhere it might be taken in either sense. The context may.
Let regimen be kept in its Latin form3 an English equivalent might narrow
its meaning. Dc Legibus is not a work in which the regimen sacerdotii,
as a subject by itself, is considered. Though in one place or another consid·
erable space is devoted to a discussion of the relation of the clergy and of the
courts Christian to the secular arm of the law, there is no special section of
the treatise as a whole given over to the subject of the priesthood. From
this standpoint tractatas on f. 107 might referto the entire work. But is
that what it is meanttc dol Itis hardly in so broad a setting as all that.
These first words of chapter nine reach back rather than forwerd; they are
connected by every essential of continuity with what has immediately pre-
ceded. Chapter eight has been devoted to the general subject of judges and
judgments. Its last two sections begin the more specific topic of jurisdiction,
which is also the subject of chapter nine. So close is the connection that on
reading the text there is no feeling of any break between the two chapters.
In section four of chapter eight the main ideas are these: he who judges
should have jurisdiction; jurisdiction may be ordinary or delegated3 with
jurisdiction should go the power to put ajudgment into executi0n; not every
judge has jurisdiction and power in every case. Section five in its bearing on
the point under consideration is important enough to be given in full, together
with the first sentence of chapter nine:

“Sunt enim causae spirituales in quibus iudex secularis non habet cogni-
tionem nec executionem, cum non habeat coertionem. In hiis enim causis
pertinet cognitio ad iudices ecclesiasticos, qui regunt et defendunt sacerdo·
tium. Sunt autem causae seculares quarum cognitio pertinet ad reges et
principes qui defendunt regnum, et de quibus iudices ecclesiastici se intro-
mittere non debent, cum eorum iura sive iurisdictiones limitatae sunt et
separatae, nisi ita sit quod gladius iuvare debeat gladium, est enim magna
differentia inter sacerdotium et regnum.
