BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

that in a varying number of manuscripts many of the additiones whose places
are not fixed are found at points which the printed text chooses for the end of
sections or chapters. Thus by referring to the collation above it will be seen
that the addieio on f. 3 is put at the end of section three by a larger number of
manuscripts than those which follow the printed book and insert it in the
midst of that section. The “Addicio de Cartia'’ on f. 34 is put at the end of
section two by nine manuscripts and at the end of section three by fourteen others.
lnstances of this sort could be multiplied. All the evidence tends to show
that the most likely resting place fora “floating” addicio was at the end ofa
division of text in that particular manuscript in which the additio was moved
from the margin into the text proper. And it is fairly certain that such an
original point of text division might be rather easily lost in the descendants of
this manuscript, by comparison, corrections, or otherwise. Apparently in some
of the manuscripts spaces for additiones were lert at the end of prominent
divisions of the text. Such spaces as are found in LA, for instance, can
hardly be explained on the ground that they were lett' for the rubrics. This
placing of addicionas at the end of sections of text accounts for the fact that
some manuscripts have an additio at the very point where other manuscripts
have another and different addida—a common occurrence. It is perfectly plain
from what has been said that before some of the addicimus were brought into
the text of such manuscripts as contain them, enough generations, measured
by the reproduction of the manuscripts, had elapsed to create different points
of paragraph division. On the face of it this would suggest that those
addiciones which are most regular as to place are the older, while those which
are put by the copyists in a number of different places are of later origin. But
when we attempt on this basis to separate the Bracton from the non-Bracton
additiones we run into difficulties at once. The theory may be correct, but in
this as in so many other things connected with the manuscripts, the very
general practice of comparing one manuscript with another has produced a set
of conditions so involved as to defy the operation of any rule or law. For the
same reason no definite statement which will apply in all cases can be made in
regard to those additiones which occur in manuscripts which have additional
matter in both margin and text, whether this is marked as additional or not.
For these passages may or may not represent addc'cionm of different ages and
from different sources. They may represent the exemplar only, or the
exemplar plus additions due to later comparisons with other manuscripta.
These later additions may have come from a manuscript in the same family
