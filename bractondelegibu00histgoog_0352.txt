BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

between ME, ΜΗ, CC, LB, which may be found in the text proper at this
and other places, as onfs.161-162b,is altogether lacking here. There was
something more than a suggestion of relationship between ΜΕ, ΜΗ, CF, LT,
in the variants of the collation of the main text in this passage3 the relation-
ship is very marked here in the addida. CF, LT, CA, X, LD, in the passage
immediately preceding this were seen to have come down a single branch
line; apparently they hold the same position here. It is therefore exceedingly
probable that some ancestor of ΜΕ and MH was influenced by a manuscript
in the CF-LD group‚ very greatly in the matter of the amidam, and to a
less degree in the main text. Both ME and MH (as CF and LT also for that
matter) are of the type of manuscripts which show corrections and copying
from more than one line. Their textual value is low, CA, X, LD, for this
particular passage at least, showing far fewer mistakes and misreadings. The
changed position of ΜΕ and MH in the oddr'rio may be expressed thus:

(Ι), by its omission of the addida, is again marked off as a separate group.
(ΙΙ), including OC, has a place of its own for the additional passage, OD, CE,
PH, OG, choosing the same position, but the other members of (ΙΙΙ) either
omitting it, having it as marginalia, or putting it at a different place in the
text. The reason for this will be discussed when the subject of the inter-
relationship of (ΙΙ) and (ΙΙΙ) as regards the addicionav is taken up. The
suhgroups (CA, X), (MC, LA), (ΟΜ, W, HA), (CB, Β), (οΒ, ΗΒ), (ΟΜ,
ΗΑ), are more distinct than in the text proper. As supporting the right of
