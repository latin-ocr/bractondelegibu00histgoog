PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

passed over. Though this procedure might give to his “titulorum” a very
definite significance as faras the Roman element in his treatise is concemed‚ it
would not explain the meaning of the word in regard to the many times
greater amount of pure English law which he writes. For the latter there
were no nicely arranged titles in this sense which he could use. He would
have to make his own titles as far as the greater part of his work was con·
cemed. Considered from the standpoint of the whole treatise‚ titulos, as
Bracton uses it, can not mean merely a title from his Roman exemplars. He
does not intend it in such a restricted sense. Granted that he might take a
title from the Institutes as one of his titles.¹ That would be because this
particular heading in the Roman law book appealed to him as suitable for one
of his larger divisions‚ not because there was anything peculiar to the title
itself which made it inevitable that he should choose it. For what Bracton
evidently had in mind was an arrangement of large topics with smaller
subdivisions. His “paragraph'' also, as applied to the treatise‚ is a somewhat
flexible term. It can hardly mean the equivalent of one of the minor
subdivisions in a title of the Institutes3 it is more akin to the shorter chapter
or longer section of the printed text. Bracton does not speak of “capitula ”
Very few of the manuscripts have, as ΜΒ, any definite reference to, or
arrangement by, nnmbered chapters, In most of the codices the text is
blocked off in portions-starting with an indented line, and introduced usually,
though not invariably‚ by a rubric-which might be called either chapters,
titles‚ or paragraphs, according to the size and importance of the particular
portion and the standpoint from which it is regarded. They are not marked
off as chapters generally are by any numerical notation. Oiten they are
subdivided into lesser parts, the rubricator with his crescent marks of red or
blue paint sometimes separating each sentence; but a great number of these
subdivisions could hardly be called paragraphs in any sense of the word* If
paragraphorum on f. 1 is to referto anything more than asmall section,a
section sometimes no more than a line or two in length, it must be applied to
one of the larger blocks of text. What is, under the circumstances avery
instructive ¹note on this subject is found in ΟΕ on the second page of its forty·
second folio. After the first sentence of chapter XXXV, f. 77b of V, is over

¹See f. 1081), “de quibus superius dictum est in titulo de donationibua.” Cf. f. 19. Tha expression in
titulo dc donationibus will be found again on f. loobaud f. 266. see also f. 16, “dicetur plenius in titulo de
acquirenda possessione‚'' and f. 90, “secundum quod inferius dicetur de exceptionibus in titulo de
prohibitionibus.”

vlu of V ou fs. abab) is divided into just thirty of thare minor divisione.
