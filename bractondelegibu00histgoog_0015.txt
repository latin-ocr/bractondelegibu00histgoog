PREFACE

This volume is not intended as an introduction to Braeton. lt simply
represents the work which had to hedone to clear the way for a new text of
the De Legibus. Before any attempt could be made to reconstruct the
correct text two all important questions had to be answered: (1) What

manuscripts should be used as the basis of the new text? (2) What passages
in the printed text are additions or interpolationsl The following pages have
been devoted to answering these questions in their different ramilieations‚ it is
hoped satisfactorily. Nothing else has been attempted. The Latin text,
with variant readings and commentary, will appear in volumes two and
three. Volumes four and five will contain an English translation of the
Latin text. The introduction will be reserved until the sixth, and last,
volume, aster a continued study of Bracton’s work has rendered the editor
more competent to write it.

In this edition the traditional name of Bracton has been kept. Granted
that to his contemporaries the author was known as Henry of Bratton, by all
the world since he has been called Bracton, and the associations which connect
him with others great in the history of English law cluster about the latter
name. For the same reasons the traditional Anglioe in the title has not been
changed to the probably more correct Anglicoois.

It will become apparent to those who read further into this book that
some of the traditions connected with Bracton’s text have not been so readily
retained. The refusal tn divide the treatise into a number of books may
seem to some a piece of undesirable iconoclasm. But the facts on this point,
given in their proper place below, speak for themselves. l may add, however,
that a continued study of the manuscript texts has made me more and more
positive that Bracton never divided his own De Legibus into books. HadI
known five or six years ago some of the facts which I have learned since, it
would have been possible to make the case against a division into books
even more strong. My estimate of the Digby manuscript does not at ull agree
with the generally accepted estimate of that manuscript. It hasbeen no
