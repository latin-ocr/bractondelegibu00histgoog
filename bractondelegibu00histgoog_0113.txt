PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

find 0 001 01 addidones which can be collated for all the written copies; for this
reason the collation of additional matter can not be as far-reaching in its
results as the collation of passages from the text proper.

In character the additiones divide broadly into two classes, those coming
from Bracton himself, and those which have been added by some one other
than the author. Ι1 would be a real help in many ways if there were any
peculiarities in either the form or contextos these two kinds of additions which
would mark off one as distinct from the other. Sometimes the form 01 100
addicio will stamp it as of probably non-Bracton origin, as where it begins with
the not uncommon “Nota’' for instance; once in a while something in the
context will reveal its identity; but for the most part both types are similar,
with nothing in their appearance to easily distinguish them 000 from another.
Instead 01 100 1000 and character 01 100 addicis helping to determine the value
01 100 manuscript in which it is found, it is usually necessary to know 01 least
something 01 100 manuscript in order 10 determine the probable authorship 01
100 addida-unless 01 course, the latter has in it a reference to the Edwardian
statutes, or some other reference which hints at its date 01 composition.

By referring to the list of additional passages given below it will be seen
that some 01 100 addiciooes are found, in 000 or another of the codices, in as
many as four or five different 010000. Το0 reason for this will be discussed
later. Ι1 should be pointed out here, however, that where there is such a
decided disagreement as to the point where a particular addition should come
in, manuscripts which are closely related will usually be found to have it at the
same place. Yet the fact that two or more manuscripts agree as to the
position assigned to any addicio 000 001 always be taken as a proof 01 relation·
ship, at least 01 01000 relationship, existing between them. In this as in any

. other point in regard to the additional matter, there is 00 fact or condition so

invariable as to make possible the statement 01 0 fixed rule.

When the additions are found in the margin 01 0 manuscript it is not at
all necessary to presuppose the existence of such marginalia in the exemplar 01
1001 manuscript. This statement holds true even when the marginal oddiaiooes ·
are in the same hand as the main text. A scribe having copied the treatise

from one model might compare his finished book with another copy which
· contained more than his, writing in the margin of his own book such additional
matteras he found in the other. CB illustratas very well what might happen
when 0 book already written was compared with another which differed from
it. Ιο 1010 particular codex many of the additional passages are found in the
