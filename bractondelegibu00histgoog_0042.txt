BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

has to be expended. Even though the correct reading may be perfectly
evideut‚ and the variant an impossible form, it is the variant which is the
important thing in deciding the lineage.

lt should be kept in mind that everything pertaining to Bractou, even
his use of Roman law, is thoroughly medieval. To understand any question
connected with his book we must approach it lium the standpoint of the
medievalist rather than from that of the classical scholar or the modern
lawyer. This applies, also to the problems associated with the manuscripts of
his treatise. Though written iu Latin they are not like the written texts of
early classical authors, and can not be treated as such. On first thought it
might seem that the thirteeuth and fourteeuth century copies of this work on
English law would have to be studied in much the same way as thatin which
the editor of a classicul Latin text might study a copy of Cicero or Livy from
the same period. Up to a certain point, along the broader lines of criticism,
this would be true. In their entirety, however, the two cases are different,
certain unusual circumstances connected with the multiplicatiori of the Bracton
manuscripts uniting to form a complexity of problems peculiar to themselves
alone, and demanding special methods of solution. What the problems are
in this produnt of menevn engrano, how they aruer som those which con-
frout the editor of an Augustan writer, will be seen better as the subject is
taken up more in detail.

Viewed from any standpoiut the De Legibus is a long work, as the four
hundred and forty·four folios ol the first edition, or the six volumes in the
Rolls Series, testify. This bulkiness has had important bearings in more thau
one direction. Not only has its great length offered more opportunities
than a shorter work would have done for the usual mistakes of every kind in
copying, but the large number of solius—nearly four hundred of them in some
of the manuscripts-has tended to increase the almost inevitable loss of some
aud the binding iu wrong order of others. Moreover‚ the size of ,the treatise
led to abridgmenta from the very first. When parchment was expensive‚ and
the work of the scribe both slow and expensive‚ the copying ofa Bracton was
amatter of uo small moment. To many a man desirous of possessing it and
countiug the costos a new copy, the De Legibus must have seemed unneces·

sarily long and extended. Auything which could be cut out or passed over
briefly, so asto decrease the amount of parchment required and lessen the
scribe’s work, would mean a real saving which we can hardly appreciate. To
this consideration was added the fact that the steady stream of statutory
