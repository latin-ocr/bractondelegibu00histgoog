PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

f. aab is found in all the members of that group with the exception of OG,
and it occurs also in OD, MD, ΜΡ. That portion of the text of LB which
contains this passage bas beenlost, but there is every probability that LB
followed the same tradition in this addicti> as in the two which come after. In
the main, the manuscripts follow the same side lines as in the text proper.
OF, OM, MG, MH, MK, CB, B, HA, ΗΒ, Β, again make up oue large
group which splits up into the subgroups already noticed. Ml, LC, LD,
CA, CH, continue to show the same relationship, but now MF and X are
associated with them, and more closely with CA and CH than with the
others. MI and LC preserve their pair gronp relationship. OD and MD
are more closely connected with OC than with any other of the manuscripts
involved, MD being the nearer to OC. ML shows a tendency to agree with
both LD and CA, more than once following the reading of one contrary to
the other. The grapbic representation of the relationship of the manuscripts

will therefore remain the same as that already given, except that MD and
MF have to be brought over from (Ι) to (ΙΙ), and ML and X moved about,

The additio which occurs in the printed text ou both f. 33 and f. Bab is
found in practically the same manuscripts as the additional passage on f. aab,
except that this second addicti> is found also in OG, ME, Y, LB, and is
omitted in MF, ML, X. In OD, ΜΕ, Y, it is marginal. A scarcity of
variants makes it difficult to work out the details, but we get enough informa-
tion to assure us that the groups OF, OM, CB, etc, and MI, LC, LD, CA, l
CH, maintain their identity. OC, OD, OG, MD, are related. The marginal ¹
passage in Y has been taken either directly from CA or from an exemplar but l
one generation removed from CA. ME has derived its marginal passage

from some manuscript in the line of OM, MH, LB, HA. The changes may
be shown thus:
