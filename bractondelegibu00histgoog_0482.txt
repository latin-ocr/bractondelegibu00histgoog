quiesi tulis. In such acase there is always ground for the suspicion that
irregularities are due to an omission, and in this particular instance the suspicion
is increased because the passage is found at a single place in the text or
omitted entirely. In spite of the lact that it is so generally repudiated by

manuscripts in (I) and (ΙΙΙ) the present editoris inclined to regard it as an
omission rather than as an addicio. As to the value οἰ an omission in LA for
this part of the treatise see the remarks on the audicio, fs. 278b279b
below

ΟΕ, ΜΟ (which has just before it in the text, Cusus Gortyn). Inserted at the
end of sect. 2, f. 270, in OC (marks additional); alter debet, l. 24, f. 2701))
ΟΕ, ΟΒ. Marginal in OA (preceded by Casus Corbio). Omitted in OB,
MA, ΜΒ, ΜΕ, ΜΙ, LA, Y, ΟΜ, MD. See Note Book, Ι, 95-08; ΙΙΙ, 600,
n. 2; and above, pp. 80-81. Though it is not unreasonable to accept this
as having come from Bracton‚ we can not be sure that it has.

Ε. 27011. 38-39. Item respondere. . . . sit. Regular in OD, ΟΕ, OG,
OC, MC, LA. Inserted aster replicationem, l. 29, f. 2701), in OB, MA, ΜΒ,
MD, ΜΙ, MN, Y. Marginalin OA, ME. Omitted in ΟΕ, ΟΜ. This passage
is certainly from Bracton.

Ε. 2701),11. 1-6. Itemsiquis. . . . proprietatis. Begular in OD, MC.
Inserted aster lenuit, l. 0, in OC, OG, MD, ΜΕ, ΟΜ; aster Turpia, l. 05,
f. 272, in OF. Marginal in OA. Omitted in OB, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΙ, MN, ΟΕ,
LA, Y. It is impossible to form a definite opinion in regard to this passage3
it may well be from Bracton.

Ε. 271,11. 00-35. Secundum quod . . . . ut supra. Regular inOC, OD,
OG, MD, ME. Inserted aster Joltonao, l. 28, in OF. Marginal in OA.
Omitted in OB, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΟ, ΜΙ, ΟΕ, LA, Y. The omission of this
passage in both MC and LA, gives it the appearance of an additio belonging
to (ΙΙ) alone and makes us hesitate to accept it as an addition written by
Bracton.

F. 2721), ll. 4-15. Sed sl probari . . . . ius merum. Regular in OD.
Inserted aster quare oon, l. 16, f. 27211) OF ; aster deficiat, l. 27, f. 2721), in

part, quietius. . . ,10) nurum. Marginal in OA. Omitted in OB, MA,
ΜΒ, ΜΙ, LA. Y has lost folios at this point. There may be two addit-iosus

here. Bracton was probably the writer.
