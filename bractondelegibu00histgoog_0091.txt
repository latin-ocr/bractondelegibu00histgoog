PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

ean not believe Bracton would have followed a process of composition so
wasteful of precious writing material. Then in the second place, in order to
have the situation work out along the lines assumed above, it would be
necessary not only to have the original De Legibus divided by quires as
supposed, but to have that particular codex taken apart by quires and divided
among several different scribes for purposes of copying. On the supposition
that one scribe had done all the copying the vacant spaces would have
disappeared in any book made from this original; so would they also have
disappeared ifa number of copyists not working simultaneously, had followed
one another in regular order, using the same exemplar either taken apart or
left intact. In either case there would be no reason or necessity for keeping a
certain amount of blank parchment at the end of quires. Now this is bringing
the requirements within the narrowest of limits. It is really remarkable that
OA should meet these strict requirements. We find plenty of manuscripts
written in a single hand throughout, many, also, written by several different
penmen; but in the Digby manuscript alone are there the undeniably
evident signs that a number of scribes were working simultaneously on the
same book. What a marvellous array of coincidencesl Of all the codices
which have come down to us one only had to be written in such a hurry that
the many copyists had to work at one and the same time. Only one exemplar
was to be had as a model.¹ This happened to be Bracton’s own copy, which
copy happened to be so arranged through a coincidence of quires and subject·
matter that when the quires were taken apart and distributed the many scribes
reproduced not only the text, but also the external features of the original.
And thus it has corne about that the anatomy of OA coincides with divisions
of the subject-matter, and that at the end of its quires are blank pieces of
parchment.

Now let us ask what could have been the effect upon ΟΑ if its six scribes
working at the same time had copied their parts from several different
manuscripts. The answer must be that OA would present the same appear-
ance asin the first supposed case, that is, its anatomy would still coincide with
divisions of the subject-matter, and at the end of its quires would be blank Δ
parchment. For if the copyists were working with different models before
them the only way to gauge their work would be to pick out prominent
places in the treatise, start one at this place and another at another place—

¹ Probably no one would wish to maintain that oh was the first copy made from the original Do matun.
Nor is this a necoesary supposition in Mattiand’s theory.
