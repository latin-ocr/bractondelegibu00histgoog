PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

Following out this same comparison with fs. 33b35 we get for (II) the
subgroups (OF, MG, MH, MK, CB, ΗΒ, CM, B, X), (OF, MG, MH,
CM), (OF, MG), (MH, CM), (CB, ΗΒ), (ΜΚ, Χ), (ΟΙ), LD), (OM, HA,
W, ME, CC, P), (OM, HA, W), (ME, CC, P), (OM, HA), (OC, OG).
This makes a combined group of (OC, OF, OG, OM, ME, MG, MH, ΜΚ,
ΟΒ, CC, ΟΙ), ΟΜ, HA, ΗΒ, LD, B, P, X, W). There is every probability
that CA belongs in this group, as it is found agreeing with a number of other
texts in (ID—with OF, MG, MH, CM, civili for ciali tantuna· etiam (enim)
ias for etiam, with MK, X; relatio est facto for relatione facta, with OM, HA;
an omission in place of igitur, with most of (II); and ad for qao ad, with CC.
Here as elsewhere ML gives proof that it was compiled frorn models in both
(II) and (ΙΙΙ) by a scribe who used the utmost liberty in choosing the reading
which seemed to him the most desirable. He even invented readings to suit
his own idea of fitness if he could not find in his exemplars what he desired.
Thus where all the other manuscripts are divided between ergo and uatem, ML
reads vero. Where the other texts have either igitar, ergo, oran omission (with
the exception of LD which gives se), ML substitutes enim. As a matter of
fact, ML follows no single tradition in any one particular place. With
about equal propriety it might be put in either (II) or (ΙΙΙ). OC aud OG
again have a place on the outslrirts of (II), near to group (III). The connec-
tion of ME, CC, P, with the sub-group OM, HA, W, on f. ab (reading
iustum for ius and iodicium et for et) may possibly he due to one line having
made a correction from the other, just as MA, MD, CB, have clearly been
corrected in erasures to these particular variants. But a connection between
ME, CC, P, and W, is shown in the passage on f. 5h, W having three of the
five variants peculiar to ME, CC, P. In reading qao for qua ME, P, and W
(CC omits passage) again come together. Est lea for lec as in ME, CC, P, is
the reading also of MH and CM in addition to W. Later on, the connection
of the combinations of manuscripts which run through the collated passages
will he worked out, but it may he said here that ME and MH, usually with
either P or ΟΟ, or both, are frequently found in combinatious. Such was the
group (ME, MH, CC, LB) occurring in the collation for fs. lul-reah, and the
group (OM, ME, MH, P, W, 1- others) in fs ala-arth. In this earlier part
of the text the evidence which associates ME, ΟΟ, Ρ, with both MH and W
is probably not the result of mere chance combinatious. For the present each

passage is being treated separately, and for this place the variants order us to
put ME, CC, P, atrro great distance from OM, HA, W. We may express
