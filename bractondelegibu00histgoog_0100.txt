BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

as to its superiority or inferiority. Not only are unused lines or leaves of
parchment found in the other written copies of Bracton, but there is nota
single feature of OA in the matter of leaving blank spaces which can not be
found in at least one, and usually in several, of the other codices.¹ To take up
this subject in any sort of detail, even omitting such illustrations as have been
given already in one place or another, would require too much time and space.2
Itis sufficient here to simply state that the more the other manuscripts are
closely examined the less remarkable in any way seem the peculiar traits of
Digby 222.

This is true of another feature of the same manuscript which should be
touched upon in this place. In that masterly introduction to Bractoa’r Note
Boolc⁸ OA again comes in for great praise because in its margins are jottings
which would seem to connect it in some way with the Note Book, and thus
more directly with Bracton. Briefly stated the facts are these. In the Note
Book one of the annotators, who may or may not be Bracton himself, “notes
up” certain cases. Opposite four of these cases he makes some allusion to
Corbyn. On f. abab of the printed Bracton is a reference to one of the cases⁴ in
the form of an addicis, which in OA is marginal and has above it the words
Cusus Carbia. Another case⁵ in the Note Book has opposite in the margin

the note, “Casus Radulphi de Arundelle similis isti in Comubia.” At the
bottom of f. 98 in ΟΑ is the note, “Memorandum de casu R. de Arundelle.”

² A render of Broetoa aad Aac, p. 240, might get the impression that the margins of ΟΑ are unusually

wide-“lt has ample mergium these were required for the oddieioasr.” By referring to the measurements in Ι

the description of the manuscripts given above it will be seen that many of the MSS. have as wide margins as
ΟΛ, and some even wider.

¹ The following facts may be brought forwerd, however, as having a somewhat more important bearing
on this subject. Before its third book OB leaves blank all of one page and all but live lines (which are used for
the Iaeipitlon the next pege. Preceding its fourth book are about two and one-half peges of empty space.
The fifth book is preceded by about the same amount of blank parchment. LG has a space of half a column
at the end of book l, and a column at the end of both book ΙΙ and book ΙΙΙ. CH ends its first book in sect. 6,
f. 35 of V. A space of one and one-half columns follows. MM leaves a whole column of empty space between
“dicebat quod nihil” and “tenuit de hereditate,” f. 386 of V. ln LD one quire ends with “ut de ter'’ -l- a
column of space. The next quire begins “mino Paschae anno,” etc., ss on f. 413 of V. ln LA quire F begins
cap. ΙΙΙ, f. 11s-a prominent place-end has two excised folios at the end. Quire G begins at another subject,
cap. XVl, f. 135b. Quire L, aster a space of nearly a column, begins with sect. 4, f. 199. M begins at sect. 6,
f. slah, astera blank space of 1⁵ lines. At the end of quire N almost a whole page is blank, Ο beginning
with sect. 2, f. 269, and leaving about a page of space at the end. Quire P begins with the Assise Utrum, as
does quireSof ΟΑ. ln other words, these portione of La were apparently copied according to a method
similar to that used ln making ΟΑ. Points of more or less prominence were choses in the exemplar to serve as
the beginning of quires. These were not the same points as those chosen by the makers of ΟΑ, but the
method pursued resulted in vacant spacea attha end of the quires forali that.
