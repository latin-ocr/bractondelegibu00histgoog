BBACTON: DE LEGIBUS

F. 13, ll. 35-37. Vel procuratricem vel. . . . in fiae rotali. Regular in
OC, MG, ΟΜ, Β (marks additional). Omitted in OA, OB, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΟ,
ΜΕ, ΜΝ, CC, ΟΕ, MD, LA, Y. This is clearly an added statement; the
citation is made in the style of Bracton, but in view of the slender support
given it by the manuscripts it is exceedingly doubtful if he was the author.

Fs. labli, 11283. Et schediae qaod. . . . ad aeram mnam. Regu-
lar in OF, MG, ΜΗ, CM. Omitted in OA, OB, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΟ, MN, ΟΕ,
LA, Y. On a separate slip of parchment in ΕΟ. Marked additional in B.
Some manuscripts have divided this addicio into two parts, the second
beginning with Et generaliter poterit res, and taking in the last five linea.
MD marks the first part with adamatam usqae hoc. W inserts the passage
at the end of sect. 7, f. 14. The first part of it is put by OC aud MD after
et alias terminum, l. 25, f.1ab; the second part is inserted by MD aster
procuratorem, l. 35, f. 13, aud in OC is put iu the bottom margin and marked
to come after poterit donatia 134, f. lab. This is clearly no part of the
original text of Bracton. Its omission by group (1) is what we should expect.
That it is also missing in the best manuscripts in (ΙΙΙ) argues strongly for its
having come from some other source than Bracton.

F. 14b, ll. 7-19. Etnotaadamqaod. . . . elalius adrtitati. Omitted
in OA, OB, OD, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΟ, ΜΝ, ΟΕ, LA, Y. On a separate slip of
parchment in LC. Inserted aster proprio vel alieno, l. 5, f. 13, in OC, OG,
MD (marks as additio recriada usqae hac); alter minoris, 1. 2, f. 13, in MH,
MG‚B (marks additional); at the end of sect. 5, f. 121), in ME, W. This
passage is clearly out of place in the position given to it in the printed text.
Seemingly an early written addicio, but in all probability not from Bracton.

F. 15, end of sect. 9. For the qaod arediate subsequitur· of V read, Breve
aalma de mittendo (ad mittendam) IIII militer ad impotentem ad audiendum
confessionem raam et per (qood) breve istud procedit tale erit (breve), OA, OB,
ΟΕ, LA, CM, ΜΒ, ΜΟ, MD, MG, MN, Y. Omitted in ΟΟ, ΜΕ. Used
as a rubric in OC, MA. Apparently a part of the original text.

F. 16, l. 23. Quia licet emor. . . . in re errant. Regular in OC, CC,
MC, MD, ΜΕ, ΟΜ, LA. Omitted in OA, OB, MA, MN, ΜΒ, ΟΕ, Υ.
Probably one of Bracton’s own additions. A typical explanatory aster·
thought, introduced by the usual qaia.

F. 16b, ll. 7·8. Ut probatarC ..... et L. sequenti. Omitted in OA,
OB, OC, OD, OE, OF, OG, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΟ, MD, ME, ΟΕ, ΟΜ, LA.
Obviously not from Bracton.
