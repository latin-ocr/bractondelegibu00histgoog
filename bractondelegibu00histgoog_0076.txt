BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

about two-thirds—of the work. It has already been pointed out that in this
portion of his book Bracton writes by treatises.¹ Fundamentally his plan of
composition has not changed. By titles and sub-topics he continues to work,
only now his main titles have become big enough, or rather his knowledge of
the subject is extensive enough, to farmish material for a whole treatise. He
is not writing by books any more than at the beginning3 the subjects, or rather
his treatment of them, are entities in themselves. His scheme in civil actions,
as outlined at the start, is to treat of real before personal actions, and of
possession before property—“Dictum est supra de actionibus criminali·
bus. . . . Nunc autem dicendum est de actionibus civilibus. Et huiusmodi
quaedarn sunt reales et quaedam sunt personales, sed primo de realibus actionibus
dicatur. Et est rerum possessio et est proprietas, et primo dicendum est de
possessione quarn de proprietate ratione supradicta.’'¹ Under possession will
come the Novel Disseisin, Mort D’ancestor, Last Presentation, Consanguinity,
Utrum, Dower; under property, Entry and the Writ of Right. If anything
more thau the way in which these subjects are treated in the text is needed to
prove that Bracton considered them entities in themselves, it is only necessary
to turn to the places where he mentions thern by name. As early as f. 39 he
refers to the treatise of Novel Disseisin⁸ Not only is the block of text
devoted to the assise of mort d'aucestor so labelled,⁴ but on f. 20 there is a
direct reference to it.⁶ The treatment of the assise ultimae praesentationes as
a subject in itself is noted on f. 23th Consanguinity and Utrum are each
introduced by passages which leave no doubt as to their identity.⁷ Dower has
earmarks of its own in addition to the text matter itself.⁸ All of the above

¹ see above, p. 50.

² With the closing words of this passage compare the beginning of sect. 4, f. 113. “Et quod de posses-
sione prius agendum sit quarn de proprietate, et quod causa possessionis est praemittenda, quamvis in fine
debeat proprietas praevalere, videri poterit manifesta’·

⁸ “ltem possessionum alia iusta alia iniusta, secuudum quod inferius videri poterit in tractatu de assisa
noste dissaisinae.” See also the end of sect. 5, f. 85, “secundum quod inferius videri poterit de assisis.”
Another reference to the same trectise occurs on f. olb.

⁴ cap. 1, f. 252.
⁸ “Ut infra de assisa mortis antecessoris, de herede Jobannis Dacy.”

⁸ “Dictum est supra. . . . Nunc autem dicandum est de pertinentiis quae consistunt in iure et iu
proprio, sicut de seisiua praestandi . . . .’'

l On f. etl-“Cum assisa mortis antecessoris infra certos gradus limitetur ..... in subsidium assisa
mortis antecessoris provisum est quoddam breve quod dicitur breve de consanguinitate, ut cauam possessionis
terminet in gradibus et personis ad quos assisa se non extendit.” On f. sset-“Est autem inter alias assises
quaedam assisa quoe multum babet possessionis et iuris, quae utrumque terminat, possessionemscilicet etius
(ci. cap. 1, i. 159) . . . . Per assisam istam recognoscitur utrum tenementum de quo agitur laicum sit feodum
tenentis vel libera eleemosina . . . .'’

⁸1³. 296. “Dictum est supra . . . . Nunc autem dicendum est si contentiosa fuerit et non deliberata,
qualiter recuperanda sit dos peractionem dotis, ideo de actione dotia videndum.”
