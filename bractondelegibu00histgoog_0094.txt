BRACI'ON: DE LEGIBUS ·

folios, beginning “ante hereditatis additionem,'’ Ι. 888. Ζ, 8 fohos, beginning

Large blank spaces are found at the end οΙ quires B, E, G, H, Ο, Τ; and
shorter spaces at the end of R and Y. Hand Ι wrote quire A; II, quires B,
J, K, L, M, N,0; ΙΙΙ, quires C, D, E, H; IV, 'quires F, G, P(†one
folio of Q), R, S, Τ; V, the last eight folios of quire Q; VI, quires V, X,
Y, Ζ, Aa.¹ It would seem that the beginnings of quires A, B, C, F, H, J,
P, S, V, Ζ, and the second folio of Q, mark the points at which the text οΙ
0Αέ exemplar had been divided for assignment to different copyists.

These assignments would appear to have been made in the following
order. To handl was given the kalendar for copying. Such an allotment
would be most natural, as the table of contents almost always occupies equire
by itself. Το hand II were given a number οΙ folios estimated as sufficient
for a short quire. But these folios contained more than hand ΙΙ was expected
to copy at this particular place. Hand III could not have taken up the
copying at the point where ΙΙ was going to leave it without either omitting
something or interfering with ΙΙ. So III was started at one of the most
prominent places in the whole treatise, the place where Bracton takes up the
discussion of Actions A certain number of folios were given and he copied

them all, making out of them a quire οΙ six folios with a page and ahalf οΙ
empty parchment at the end. On account οΙ the difference in the style οΙ
handwriting, the first quire written by ΙΙΙ takes up more space than that
written hy ΙΙ. But notice that in this first assignment of material from the
exemplar they each received about the same amount.² N either of them was
to do his real work of copying at these places, but at others. They were

²Seesbove, p. t, n. l. ln his tabulation οΙ the quire scheme οΙ ΟΛ ΡτοΙ. Maitland divides the
work among eight copyiats. This is in contradiction to his statement on p. 240 οΙ Bracton asad Aac, “l believe
that the text (even when we have excluded the Kalendars or 'l'able οΙ Contenta and take no notice οΙ the
rubricators) shows the work οΙ at least live different penmen.”

’ln Bracton aad Aac, pp. 241, 184, xv, emphasis is laid on the lact that the first quire (B) written by
hand 11 ends at a point οΙ prominent division in the treatise. Some οΙ the statements there made should most
certainly be modilied. lt is difficult to discover any authority Ιοι· the statement, “We may infer that in
Bracton’a own MS. a break occurred here.'' ln Bracton'a scheme, aa the outline given on p. 60 above will
show, the more prominent break comes not st cap. V on Ι. 11, but st cap. lV on Ι. lob, “De acquirendo rerum
dominio ex causa donationis inter vivos” being but one οΙ a number οΙ subjecta under the greater head οΙ “De
diversis modia acquirendi ex iure civili.” Moreover, the amount οΙ Roman law in fs. 11-98 is by no means as
manger aa we might be led to suppose. To be sure, the amount οΙ pure English law in thia portion oi the text
ia relatively greater thau in the preceding ten tonos, but a study οΙ the text will quickly show that it is by no
means correct to think οΙ Bracton’s dependence on the Roman lew as ending with Ι. 10. Aa far as any real
break on f. 11 is concerned it ia to be found in 0Αέ quire arrangement rather than in Bracton’a development
οΙ his subject-matter.
