Therefore OB, MA, MD, ΜΒ, ΜΝ, LF, LG, must be regarded as the nucleus
of (1), being always found in that group. ΜΙ and ΟΕ are usually in (Ι), LC
less often, but for the most part. Of the other manuscripts, MF, Y, HA, are
most often in association with this group. CF, ΕΤ, OM, follow this tradition
for a more or less considerable part of their contents.

Using asastandard (OF, MG, (OC, OG), MH, CM, MK, X, CB, ΗΒ,
Β, CC, ΕΒ, CA, ΕΒ), we have in group (Illt

OF, MG, X, are alone found in this group for all of the twelve passages. Το
them should be added Β, which has been collated for eleven of the passages,
and each time falls in (ΙΙ). Like Β, CA and ΕΒ occur in no other group3
but as they are each lacking in three or more of the portions of text chosen for
collation, their case is not quite so clear. CB, ΗΒ, ΜΚ, CC, only once go
outside the group, MK lacking one of the passages. LD is found in (ΙΙ) for
the most part. MH and CM most frequently go over to other groups3 aud .
of the manuscripts not included in our standard group (ΙΙ), ΜΕ most osten is
associated with it. W follows ΜΕ in this respect. P, CF, ΕΤ, belong in (ΙΙ)
at some places. OC and the first part of OG are in a position between (ΙΙ)
and (ΙΙΙ) rather than within (ΙΙ). As a nucleus for (ΙΙ) should be taken OF,
MG, X, Β, CB, ΗΒ, ΜΚ, CC; with CA, LD, ΕΒ, ΜΗ, CM, ΜΕ, W, in
less constant presence.
