THE ADDICIONBS

F. 2031), ll. 21-25. Item potest. . . . pacifica setena. Marginal in LA.
Regular in OA, ΟΒ, MA, ΜΒ, MC, CB, CM, Y. These same manuscripts
give regularly the passage in 1125-30, Item potest . . . . io casa, which is
omitted by LA. Both passages clearly belong in the text.

F. 209, 11. 6-23. Est etiam uliud . . . . scca conventio. Marked as
additional by Β, but given regularly in OA, OB, MA, ΜΒ, MC, ME, LA,
CM, Y, and therefore undoubtedly written by Bracton himself.

Β. 2101). Νο1 in V. Sed revera nlltilorttnas procedet cessassem resti-
tutione aed veras deniers irc mtsert'eordr‘a pro usurpatione. Inserted at the end
of cap. XXIX, in CM; after conticetis, l. 17, in B (marks additional).
Omitted in OA, MA, ΜΒ, MC, MD, LA, Y. This must be rejected as an
interpolation.

F. 211,11.15-17. Oportet. . . . per ee. MarginalinLA. Inserted atter
alia, l. 20, in OA, ME, ΟΕ, CM, MD, Y, and OB, MA, ΜΒ, which omit
oportet. . . ..sit io alio· aster (10101010, 1. 26, in MC. An addicto from Bracton.

F. 212, ll. 33-40. Et quidsi . . . . erto. Regular in OD. Inserted
alter sect. 1, l. 1, in OC, OG, MD; after regis, l. 11, in OF, MI; after
equitate, l. l, f. 2121), in MC, LA. Marginal in OA. Omitted in OB, MA,
ΜΒ, ΜΕ, CB, Y. Presumably from Bracton.

F. 2121), 11. 37-33. Item dcere. . . . pretendere. In the text 01 OC,
and OF, MI, CM, which insert after penetralis, l. 41. Used as a rubric in
MC. Marginal in OA, LA. Omitted in OB, OD, MA, ΜΒ, CE, Y.
MD omits the second Item dicere . . . . iuratores. This was certainly no part
01 the original text. It can not, therefore, be regarded as an omission. It
has the appearance of a marginal note added by some one other than the
author, who would hardly have repeated himself in this way.

Fs 2121)-213, 1113-1. Eter' . . . . dico. Regularin OF, ΜΙ. Inserted
aster cognoscendi, 12, 1. 213, in OC, MD, MC. Marginal in OA, LA.
Omitted in OB, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΕ, CE, CM, Y. This is clearly a note added
to the text as first written. The dico would seem to attach it to Bracton,
who rather frequently used the first person singular in this way. On his use
of respondeo see above, p. 363, n. 1. See als0, credo aliud esse dicendam,
1. 321; nolo teserem, f. 3291); quod ego 000 approbo, 1. 22; raon ordeo quare
non, f. 2171).

F. 2131),11. 39-43. Et siue. . . .ut infra. Begular in OC, OD, OF,
MD, ΜΙ. Inserted asterdooatt'ortlbra, l. l, 1. 214, in MC. Marginal in OA,
LA. Omitted in OB, MA, MB, ME, ΟΕ, Y. Seemingly from Bracton,
