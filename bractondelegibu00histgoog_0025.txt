MANUSCBIPTS

spread the work over a period long enough to have allowed his handwriting
to change noticeably. In view of these facts the present writer would not
care ιο be too insistent upon the number of hands employed in some of the
manuscripts. For the same reason, also, he has probably underestimated
rather than overestimated the number in some cases.

OA. Bodleian Library, MS. Digby 222. XIII-XIV cent, single
columns in six hands of various styles¹ 183 folios, of which the first eight

are devoted to a table of contenta laxat, lssixssh 10(})x5l(6}). 54-70 lines
ιο a page. Incomplete, lacking the whole treatise on Dower, and ending

within mano domim regie detineat on f. 44οι of the printed text. A detailed
description of this MS. is given in Vol. VIII of the Selden Society Publica·
tions (Brectoa aad Aeo), pp. aea-250}

OB. Bodleian Library, MS. Bodley170. Late XIII cent, court hand,
single columns. A table of contents occupies the first 18 folios, the text
proper extending over fs. 19-385. ΙΙὲκὸὲ, ΙΟῧΧῚὲ, ilitlht. 30-36 lines ιο
apage. Incomplete because of a lacuna on f. 219, where the text reads, se
labuerit vel stricte. Si autem plures fructuarium valebit inpetratio, thus
omitting fs. eeoaol of the printed text.⁸ The name of Bracton occurs in
the text on f. l, Ego H. de Braetone talis animam ereei. (In both the
incepit and the Explicit the nemeis spelled Brottone.) This MS. has been
referred to as “Corbet'’ the name of J oannes Corbet being on f. 1, and Codeoe
Corbetti molinam noa mato libenter illi clarus ego clarus et ille miii on
taath.
