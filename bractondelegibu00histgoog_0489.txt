inasmuch as the passage is so generally vouched for by the manuscripts in (ΙΙ)
and (ΙΙΙ), we can hardly do otherwise than ascribe it to him. It may well be
that in the original note a space was 1011 aster termino to be filled in later with
the correct reference. In at least one of the manuscripts such a space is to be
found. The reference 10 the year and term in MD was in all probability not
added by Bracton (it would be given in other manuscripts were that the case),
but it is important as showing how later users of the treatise could make a
citation in Bracton's typical form.
