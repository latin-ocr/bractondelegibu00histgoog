BRACPON: DE LEGIBUS

would most naturally have used this mark ADDI 010. Other writers or
commentators would in all probability have preferred GLOSSA to denote
their contributions to the text. It is all a question of belief and not of proof,
but it seems very reasonable to believe that this word ADDI CI 0 was chosen
hythe author to make clear the fact that the passages so marked were out and
out additions of his own and in no sense glossas of another. In one manu-
script or another a noticeable amount of this additional matter is labelled as
such. No one manuscript is at all complete in this respect. But it is clear,
both that addicimus were very early marked and that no one line continued
long to mark many of them, though every line preserved a few of the
distinguishing signs—enough, as it were, to indicate the earlier abundance.

What proves conclusively that OA and its marginalia did not come from
an original copy in which the author’s additions appeared in the margins is the
fact that there are to be found in the main text of even the best portions of
that manuscript both addideram from Bracton and those that are of doubtful
origin. Inasmuch as additiones are also to be found in the main text of both
ΟΕ and LA, and even more frequently than in the Digby manuscript,
neither of these two codices may claim the distinction denied to OA. In
spite of their usual omissions so many addicioraes are imbedded in the text of
one or the other of these three manuscripts that they outnumber those to be
found in (Ι). Regarded from the standpoint either of its main text or
marginal passages (ΙΙΙ) is a group abounding in adamas, and in this respect
as in the matter of text tradition it naturally occupies a position between (1)
and (ΙΙ). This group is, all things considered, on a higher plane of general
excellence than either (1) or (ΙΙ). But any prestige which it may have is not
· imparted to it by the chance combination of quire scheme and marginal
addicimus to be found in 0A.¹

Points of similarity or contradictions in regard to the matter of the absence
or presence of particular additions in the members of (ΙΙΙ) can be most
concisely brought out in the following tabulated form. Fuller details may
be had by reference to the list of additiones below. In order to bring out all
possible points of comparison the text of the trectise is taken up in portions
corresponding to those written by the different hands in OA. As facts which
may help to strengthen or modify conclusions it should be kept in mind that
the collation of a number of addicimus has shown: (1) that OD may borrow
