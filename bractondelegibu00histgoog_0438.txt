BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

is therefore on the same footing as the passage on f. 163, probably, though not
positively, from Braeton. And all of this fits into the theory which has been
advanced for the determination of the authorship of an addicto on the basis of
the groups which vouch for it. According to that theory the' following
equations should, in general, be correct: (Ι) ÷ (ΙΙΙ) ÷·(11) = an additio from
Braeton‚ (Ι) ÷ (111) - (ΙΙ) = an addicto from Braeton‚ (ΙΙΙ) ÷(11)-(1)=
an addicto from Bracton. The last two of these equations graphically represent
the facts in regard to the two passages just considered. (Ι), then, is keeping
within the demands of the theory in treating them as it does.

One other point should be diseussed at this place. J udged on the basis of
its marginal agreement we should expect to find LA agreeing in the readings of
its addit-iones with either ΟΑ or Y in this portion of the treatise. In the
additio near the beginning of f. 161b, LA agrees more closely with MC than
with any other manuscript, while Y and OG have the largest number of
variants in common. This is in keeping with the relationship which the
manuscripts show for their main text. OA does not pair off with any other
manuscript in its variants for the passage; ΟΕ omits. In the last addicio on
f. 166b, which only ML omits and which LA and Y have in the margin, the
relationship of the manuscripts has undergone a change. Most noticeuble of
all is the fact that out of the thirty manuscripts compared, OA, MC, ΟΕ and
Y alone give reinna (instead of feoffumento) as the last word. In its readings,
LA agrees no more closely with any one of these four than with any of the
other twenty-five manuscripts collated. In l. 26, OA, ΟΕ and Y have sicut
in place of breve· ΟΕ and Y omit the firnuraus in the next line-the agree·
ment in each instance being against all others. It is very clear that LA did
not get this uddzbio from the same source as the manuscript with which it
agrees in the text, Mc, or from the same source as Y, which like LA is
marginal here. If now we turn to the aduno already collated in sect. 5,
f. 179b, which is marginal in OA and LC, omitted in (Ι), and inserted in the
textos Mc, LA, ΟΕ, Υ, and manuscripts generally, we find MC and LA
again pairing off as to variants, while Y agrees more closely with OG than
with any other manuscript though showing in larger matters a fairly consistent
agreement with ΟΕ. All these facts but emphasize what has before been
stated, that a manuscript may agree with one line in its main text and with
another line in the addiciones. Itis clear also that the addiciorws in the margin
of a manuscript may have come down through adifferent tradition from the
addit-imme inserted in the text.
