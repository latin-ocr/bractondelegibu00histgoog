PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

have to work over that part of his book as over the more academica] and
theoretical first part which he had drawn so largely from the not so well
understood Roman sources. This portion on the assises he may well have set
apart by itself at the very beginning.¹ He may have intended ultimately to make
this one of a number of definite divisions in his book when it had been worked
into a satisfactory final form. If so, that time never came; the book was leit
imperfect in this respect aa it was in the matter of text. But we 'can not be
sure that Bracton ever intended to arrange his linished treatise by books. For
him to have done so would have been very natural. His Roman law models
were divided into books. So also was his English predecessor, and in away
exemplar, Glanvill. Moreover‚ Flete and Britton, based on the De Legibus
and coming not long aiter, were likewise to be divided into books. It was
usual and customary that along work like his should have divisions of this
kind3 we should expect to find them. But if Bracton ever formulated a plan
of this sort all external evidences of it have disappeared.²

From intemnl evidence, 'from hints dropped here and there in the body of
the text, we are able to get an inkling of the plan on which Bracton worked.
A treatise of such length he could not well write in a haphazard sort of way.
The scope of the work would compel him to map out at the very beginning
some sort of outline for his own guidance. Now and then we come upon some of
this framework not entirely concealed by the text built up around it. Not much
of it shows, yet enough to reveal some of its more important lines. There are
direct statements as to his purpose in writing the book, and indirect information
as to the method he followed. From both of these sources we are able to get a
tolerably clear idea of what he was trying to do and how he went about it.

His reason for writing the book is told at the beginning. Briefly it is
this. Almost all countries use written laws; England alone uses unwritten
laws and customs. Since these unwritten laws are often perverted by judges
not learned in the law, Bracton proposes to reduce them to writing.³ He is

¹ The may should be emphasired. This statement is more s concession to the fact that so many of the
MSS. mark off this portion as a separate book than a probability in itself. Tho outline of the schemebon which
Bracton worked—given below—shows plainly thatin his mind the whole subject ol civil actions formed a unit.

' The fact that so many of the codices ere divided into books is proof only of tho common practice ol
thus dividing long treatisea On this point compare Brittan with &manill and Flete.

'The important part ol the passage reads, “ad instructionem saltem minorum, ego (Henricus de
Brattono), animum erexi ad vetera iudicia iustorum perscrutando diligenter non sine vigilis et labore, facta
ipsorum, consilia et responsa, et quicquid inde nota dignum inveni in unam summam redigendo sub ordine
titulorum et paragraphomm, sine praeiudicio melioris sententiae, compilavi.” With this, es showing that
Bracton continued to keep in mind the minores, compare the beginning of cap. V, f. alth, “Quia diversimode
fit irrotulstio essoniorum secundum diversitatem brevium et placitorum, ed instructionem minorum, dicendum
erit de irrotulstione.” Seealso bis furtheruseof the expression rim prnisda'eio nuliorisrsntsntioe on f.asb,r.119b.
