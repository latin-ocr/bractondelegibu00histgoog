BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

the work divided it. For a long time references to passages when not cited
by folio, have been cited by book, treatise, chapter, and section, because the
codex which he happened to choose as his model was so arranged. On just as
good authority he might have used many another scheme, might even have
arranged ‘the matter by centense or capitula. As it is, he has sueceeded in
making it inevitable that the idea of component books should be associated in
our minds with the thought of Bracton’s treatise. The codices are not
responsible for this idea. Of the thousands who have read Bracton in the last
three hundred and fifty years only a few have gone back to the manuscripts.
lt is only within the last generation that there has appeared in print evena
hint that the arrangement in V was not the only one found in the manuscripts.¹
A habit of thought is hard to change. lt will be difficult for any one who
has used any of the three present editions of Bracton to think of his work as
not being arranged according to books, even though it be known that the
manuscript evidence does not sanction such a device as the author’s own.⁹ The
text itself-and it is to the text that we must turn now that the external
features of the codices are discredited-shows two things in regard to this
matter of division, namely, that Bracton wrote by subjects and treatises, and
that he did not finish his book. Some subjects he could practically finish on
the first dratt. To others he seems to have found it necessary to turn back
from time to time. That part of the treatise which is made into one book by
so many of the manuscripts, and so distinctly marked off by him in the text,
that portion from the beginning of the civil actions up to the Writ of Right,
was quite likely finished at the first writing.⁸ In it he was dealing with
familiar subjecta, with the law of his own English courts. There would be
little that second thought might lead him to add to Novel Disseisin‚ Mort
D'ancestor, etc. He knew all that pertained to these subjects from the first.
References to cases, perhaps, or illustrations of one sort or another, he might
put in later for the sake of added cleamess or emphasis; but he would never

² That is, with the exception of some soattered remarks found in Selden’s Latin works, which would be
known only to ao small a body of readers as not to affect the general truth of this statement.

⁸ Outside of the editions themselves, Broetma aad Aac bas done most to perpetuata this idea that the De
natta should be divided into books. Aa the study to which this book was devoted neither called for nor
permitted anything more than a very cursory examination of the subject of division into parts, it was quite
proper that its author should follow the arrangement found in ΟΑ and other of ¹the better manuscripts. The
devotion to a single MS., OD, on the part of the editor of the edition in the Rolls Series ia probably responsible
for the continuance of the traditional arrangement in that edition.

⁸ Such a reference as that found on f. 39, “ secundum quod inferius videri poterit in tractatu de assisa
novar disseisinae,'' would suggest that this block of text on the assises may have been completed before some of
those portione which now precede it. See also, on f. 90, the direct citation of a osse from the assiae of Mart
D'ancestor.
