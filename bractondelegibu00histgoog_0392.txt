BRACI'ON: DE LEGIBUS

passages below. Their appearance in two places is accounted for by the fact
that some of the marginalia became what may be termed “floating’' additiones,
and found resting places in the body of the text at different places in different
manuscripts When two manuscripts which contained the same additional
passages but did not agree as to where these passages should come iir were
used as exemplars for a third, the latter might be expected to contain repeated

passages We have already noticed that the corrector of CB wrote in its ⁵ ’

margin many passages taken from the manuscript which he was using asa
guide, apparently oblivious to the fact that the same passages occurred
elsewhere in CB. If CB had been used as a model by some scribe who had
the habit-as some of the scribes did-of putting the marginalia of his ·
exemplar into the text of his own copy, it is obvious that the result would
have been a manuscript abounding in repeated passages. Repetitions of this
sort are fairly common in the manuscripts. Not to multiply instanees, we
may again call attention to the repeated passage in MD where the collation
shows (fs. «ΠΒ-4151)) that this manuscript faithfully preserves two different
traditions, not only in regard to the position assigned to the passage, but even
in the variant readings Another case of exaetly the same thing is found
earlier in MD (f. aab, ll. 15-28), Sirenem rwusfhccn't. . . . at saprad'ctam est.
ln ΜΙ the additional matter which makes up the most ο1 fs. 282-2821) in V
(Sine praeiudicio sententiae ocelim-rs. . . . tam recenti secana) is given regularly
in the usual place, and also occurs as two separate additiones which are inserted
at quite different places. The long addim on 1. 277 (Εἰ notandam quod
semri. ...supervenientem defletur) is to be found in OG on f. 278b and
again on f. 280b. ME has in both text and margin the additae, Sed cam ante
plenam. . . . et heimeradi on 1. arab. A similar repetition of an additio
occurs in W, on 117 of V. Itis much more probable that the first editor
of the treatise used a manuscript which contained repeated passages of this
sort than that he deliberately inserted them twice as a result of any comparison
of manuscripts. Whatever the cause of their appearance in V, they are easily
disposed of and present no difficulties.

As an antithesis to its repetitions, the printed text is lacking in some
passages found more or less consistently in the manuscripts. Some ο1 these
occur so regularly in such a large number of manuscripts that there can be no
doubt as to their having been part ο1 the original text. While none of these
passages are of any great length, they are'fairly frequent. Many of them will
be found in the list of maeones below, in which have been placed all passages
