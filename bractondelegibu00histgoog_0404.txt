BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

beyond any doubt that these insertions are found in the Digby manuscript,
not because they were in Bracton’s own copy of his work, but because the
newly written text of OA was compared with one or more models other than
the exemplar, and all passages found in these models and not in the new
volume put in its margins. It is possible, of course, that OA exactly repro-
duced its exemplar in respect to marginalia, in which case the process of
comparison will have to be put back one generation earlier. But in either OA
or one of its ancestors this marginalia must have resulted from a comparison of
one text with one or more other texts. Exactly the same thing would have
come about ifa manuscript which contained but few or no addicionca as OB
for instance, had been compared with one which like OC or CM was rich in
them. In those quires of ΟΑ which have marginalia, the passages in the
margin are naturally most frequent at those places where the text itsclf is
lacking in addicioaea, and conversely those parts of OA which have the larger
number of addicioaca in the text show fewer marginal passages. The fact that
six of the quires in OA baveno marginal additiones (the four quires written by
hand ΙΙΙ and the last two quires in the book, written by hand Vl) strongly
hints that the comparison which produced the marginalia in the other quires
was made not in OA's exemplar but in that manuscript itself, and that the
scribes of these particular six quires either did not consult other models than
those from which they drew their text, or compared that text with others
which agreed with it. It may be pointed out, too, that the last two quires
which do not contain marginalia (Z, Aa) were written by the same hand that
was responsible for quires V, X, Y, which have the marginal passages. This is
another indication that the work of hand VI was not portioned out to him in
a single assignment. It rather helps to bear out the suggestion made on p. 76
above that this scribe probably began his work with quire Z, and alter
finishing that and the next quire went back and wrote quires V, X, Y. lt
will not be at all surprising if the complete collation of OA shows that the
two parts of the work of hand VI follow different traditions. But even with
much more to be learned we know enough to make it certain that the marginal
passages in ΟΑ are not different in either type or value from most of the
marginal passages of the manuscripts in general.

The positions assigned to the addit-iones is a matter which should be
considered. In this connection there are certain facts which stand out ina
way which on first sight appears significant. Some of the additiones occur
regularly at the same place iu all lines, some are found at different places in
