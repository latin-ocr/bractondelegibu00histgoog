BRACPON: DE LEGIBUS

MK, CC, ΕΒ, X), form asmaller combination, and (CC, ΕΒ), (ΕΙ), W), stand
out as pair groups, We find also the groups (CB, ΗΒ, Β), (ΟΒ, ΗΒ), (OC,
OG), which, as usual, doubtless belong in (11). CF and ΕΤ continue to form
a pair group. The combination (ΜΕ, ΜΗ, CM, P), is subdivided into (ME,
ΜΗ, ΟΜ), (ΜΗ, ΟΜ). From the evidence at hand it is not possible to tell
where this group belongs, but it is not at all improbable that it here occupies
the same place as for fs. lla-415b. At the latter place OM and ΕΤ (ΟΕ
omitted the passage) were in the same group with these four codices. Of the
two variants which help to bring ME, ΜΗ, CM, P, together at this place, CF
and ΕΤ agree with one, and OM with the other. However‚ neither one of the
variants is altogether determinative in itself, and as OM twice agrees with the
OF group, and CF, LT, with CC, LB, there is no surety that the group
should be the same as for fs. 418-415b. Among those manuscripts which up
to this point iu their text, in so far as we have examined it, have consistently
been found in (ΙΙΙ), OA, CE, and MC, LA, again pair off. All of which
facts are far too inconsiderable to fumish data for a graphieal illustration of
relationship; but, as always in such cases, they will be found to have a value
in the broader discussion of the pedigree.

The additio is found in the texts of only seventeen manuscripts, and in the
margins of two more. No member of (Ι) has it. In the group usually
designated as (ΙΙΙ) it was not a part of the original text in OD, ΟΕ, OA, LA.
lt is omitted in those texts which for fs. 413-415b were put in a group by
themselves namely ME, MH, CM, P, MM, CF, LT. This last is the only
fact of importance in the additio bearing on the question of the pedigree of the
text proper. It has to do with the question raised in the last paragraph as to
the connection of CF and ΕΤ with the group ΜΕ, ΜΗ, ΟΜ, Ρ. Because of
its lack of variants MM does not make its identity plain. In the text proper
it has ipatius (alone) for Inprimis, and tradidit for tradiderit with ΜΕ, ΜΗ, ΟΜ,
Ρ, CF, ΕΤ, -ΙΜΙ, ΕΟ, ΜΕ, Χ. Α variant of this latter kind, which is
produced by the very common failure ofa scribe to insert the er sign, which is
almost always used in place of the letters themselves, can not be made use of
with any degree of confidence, and for that reason, and for the fact that other
variants of a different kind were usually available, it has hitherto been passed
over for the most part. It would not be well to place too much emphasis on
the variant here. But the use of tradidit and the omission of the addicto by
MM, CF, ΕΤ, would put these manuscripts with the ME, MH, CM, P,

combination rather than with group (ΙΙ), or we may perhaps more properly
