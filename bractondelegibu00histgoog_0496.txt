BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

CB, MD. Marginal in LA. Omitted in OA, OB, OD, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΙ,
CC, Y. It should be remembered that in this portion of the treatise, OA
and CC are in (ΙΙ) and OD and Y in (1). Therefore this addr'a'o would seem
to be supported by (ΙΙΙ) and the new gmup (IV). Its authorship can not be
definitely determined; the evidence of the manuscripts is in no way decisively
against Bracton as the writer.

F. 413, ll. 17-18. Ut de itinere. . . . Notinglramt'oe. Regular in OB,
OC, OD, MA, ΜΒ, MC, ΜΕ, ΜΗ, ΜΜ, LA, LD, CB, Ρ, Y, and manu-
scripts generally. Omitted in OA, OF, MG, MK, CB, CC, ΗΒ, Β, Χ.
The case cited is not in the Note Boolc. For a discussion of this additio see
above, p. 370. As group (ΙΙ) alone omits this passage, it must be assigned to
Bracton.

F. 413, ll. 26-28. Utdeitinere . . . . de recto. Regular in OB, OC,
OD, MC, ΜΕ, ΜΗ, ΜΜ, LA, LD, CB, Ρ, Υ, and manuscripts generally.
Marginal in CB. Omitted in OA, OF, MG, CC, ΗΒ, Β. This passage has
certainly come from Bracton. lt may not be an addr'eio, but amere omission
of a case by the common ancestor of (ΙΙ) which is the only group to repudiate
it. Within these last one hundred folios of the treatise‚ both MA and LD,
in different instanees, omit not a few cases which are given regularly by
the other manuscripts. The same sort of thing in an early exemplar of
the group has probably resulted in the omission of these cases on f. 413
in (ΙΙ).

F. 413, ll. 28-29. De ordine brevium. . . . mpradtcra sunt. Regular in
OB, OD, MA, ΜΒ, MD (which has also as OC), MF, Ml, MN, LD, LG,
Y. Omitted in OM, HA, LF, LT. Inserted alter brevi, l. 23, inOC, MD,
OA, OF, MG, CC, CB, ΗΒ, Β, Χ, and other manuscripts. MC and LA
divide thi's additio into two parts and insert a part at either place. Thisis
most certainly from Bracton’s pen.

F. 414, ll. 7-9. Quod impetratur sitit . . . . eum non eit. Inserted atter
huiuamodi, l. 14, in OM, ΜΕ, ΜΗ, ΜΜ, CM, LT, P, W. Regular in the
manuscripts generally. This may or may not be an addicta· it is clearly from
Bracton.

F. 414, ll. 27-35. Et si rmus . . . . filio Godfrep. Regular in OA,
OB, OD, OF, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΕ, MG, MH, MM, CC, CB, B, ΗΒ, LC, LD,
P, W, X, Y, OM. Inserted alter alios, l. 36, in OC (marks additional),
MD (has regularly also), MC, LA, CB. Omitted in ML. The case cited is
No. 227 in the Note Book. The passage itself is certainly from Bracton.
