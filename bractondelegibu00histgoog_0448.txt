has already been said as to the form of citation being uo proof of origin one
way or another. Both of them are of the Bracton type; each cites a case
tried before that judge to whom Bracton was most fond of referring,

Martin de Pateshull; in each instance the county, York, is the same; the
dates are only two years apart, 5 and 3 Henry III. The additio onf. 180 is
strongly supported by the manuscripts, being found in every group and
subgroup with the exception of (Ι); that ou f. 320 is given only by (ΙΙ) ·l-
Mc, PH. Neither one of these cases is in the Note Book. The second isso
consistently omitted by all the better manuscripts that only the fact that it
corresponds in form so exactly to Bracton’s own method of citation preventa us
from at once refusing it a place in the treatise. The third of these citatione is
that found on f. 413, where the manuscripts differ both as to the judge and the
year. (I) reads W. de Raleigh and 30 Henry ΙΙΙ; (ΙΙ) omits the passage
entirely; the other manuscripts give Roger de Turkilby and the rath year.
In its reading (1) is wrong if no mistake has been made in the date by some
seribe; ¹the association of Turkilby and 29 Henry ΙΙΙ is in all probability
correct The· fact that this passage is found in all groups and sub-groups
outside of (ΙΙ) marks it as from Bracton. On this basis of authorship there are
seemingly only two possible explanations for the disagreement in judge and
year. One is that Bracton made an out and out mistake as he first wrote the
citation and corrected it on his later revision of the treatise. This would
explain why (Ι) bas the wrong name and date, for, ashes been stated several
times before, this group evidently came from a very early and comparatively
unrevised form of the treatise. The other explanation would be that Bracton
cited a case tried before Raleigh, but not in 30 Henry III, which date,
through the mistake of oue of the earlier copyists, became almost immediately
the year assigned to the case; an early attempt to remedy this made by some
one other than Bracton almost as soon as the ancestor of (Ι) had been copied,
resulted in 'l'urkilby and the rath year appearing in the other manuscripts.
That Bracton was with 'l'urkilby on his eyre for that year proves nothing one
way or another. It can hardly be considered as strengthening the suggestion
that Bracton made the citation wrongly at first and corrected it later, for it
is difficult to understand how he could have been mistaken both as to the
year and the judge when he himself had been on the same eyre. Still, he
may have made such a slip. As bearing on the possibility of some copyist
having made a mistake in the date of a case assigned to Raleigh, it should be
pointed out that with this possible exception Bracton nowhere cites an
