PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

“Cum autern de regimine sacerdotii nihil pertineat adtractatum istum,
ideo videndum erit de iis quae pertinent ad reguum, quis primo et principaliter
possit et debeat iudicare. '’

Here one idea follows another in the closest kind of way. Chapter nine
begins no new subject, nor does chapter ten, for the principal topic of theone
is ordinary jurisdiction‚ and of the other delegated jurisdiction, both of which
subjecta have already been started in section four of chapter eight. The main
thought lying in section five is the difference in the jurisdiction of the two
sets of courts. Just as the cognizance of secular cases belongs to the king
and leaders, qai defiadant regnum, so that of spiritual cases belongs to the
ecclesiastical judges, qui regunt ct Mandant sacerdotium. In the author’s
mind there is apparently a connection between regant and regimine, he is
thinking of the ecclesiastical judges, of the jurisdiction of the spiritual courts,
when he writes sacerdotium, just as the thought lying behind his frequent use
of regnam is clearly that of the jurisdiction which pertains to the regnam.
Nothing could be more evident than that he is mentally¹ contrasting one
jurisdiction with the other. His “de regimine sacerdotii” means “de regimine
iurisdictionis quae pertinet ad sacerdotium. ” This is the sense given to it by
the context, and the sense, also, in which it was understood by the rubricator,
as the rubrica to sections five and one will show.¹ In this sense it will not
allow tractatus as used at the same placeto refer to the whole work, for the
jurisdiction of the priesthood and the ecclesiastical forum is discussed else·
where, especially aster Bracton again takes up the subject of jurisdiction on
f. 400b.⁹ Tractatas must, therefore, have reference to the treatise on
Actions. Its use connects chapter nine with chapter eight, as does the text
as a whole, and shows that the author has not yet come to the end of the
special treatise of which these two chapters form a part. But whether this
subject of Actions should end at the place where it does in V or go on
further, is a question open to discussion.

Of Actions, in one form or another, Bracton continues to treat for the
rest of his book. Yet in the text he very clearly subdivides this large subject.
Civil actions in English courts are separated from English criminal actions;

¹'l'ba general subject of tha rubrica will be considered later. In spite of many differancea thare is a
rather remarkable agreement ln the rubrica of the different linea.

³ That tractatu at this place did not refer to the whole treatise, was the opinion of at least one man (and
perhaps two), who lived not long after the work had been finished and was responsible for the rubrica in Y and
maa “De reglmine iurisdictionis regni quia de sacerdotio nihil ad praesena.’' La has this same rubric in lta
table of contenta. ln MB's arrangement “De regimine iurisdictionum et regnl’' comas aa the fourth rubric
under “Capitnla da sc qnod dicitnr quid ait iudicium et in quibua consistit officinm.''
