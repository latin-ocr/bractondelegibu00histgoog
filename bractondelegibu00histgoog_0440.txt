sanctos: DE LEGIBUS

sort would tend only to emphasize what is now plain enough-that none of the
problema in connection with the additiones can be worked out on the basis of
either large or small combinations of manuscripts, or for large or small blocks
of text.

This is discouraging in a way, but it does not at all necessarily imply that
tbe data to be found in the list of addicioaea are useless. Actually it means
only that there is no apparent way of dealing with the addicioaea in large
numbers or for defined areas of text. Each addida must be considered
separately. This necessitates much more work, but it makes the general
situation infinitely more simple. Not that even the individual treatment of
each passage will clear up all questions. Some actaeona will have to remain
on the doubtful list until the collation of the entire texts of several manuscripts
has been completed, and even this may not be sufficient to settle the question
of authorship in all cases. But for the larger number of passages, the, facts
stand out plainly enough to make a decision as to authorship possible. As far
as (Ι) and (ΙΙ) are concerned there is hardly ever any doubt. From the very
nature of the manuscripts which make up that group it will not always be easy
to decide whether or not (ΙΙΙ) supports a given addicio, though the determina-
tion of such a fact is greatly simplified when the passages are taken up one by
one. Moreover, the combined weight of many kinds of evidence, no one of
which goes very far by itself, helps out materially when only a single addicis
is being considered.

Itis evident from the foregoing that a consideration of the problems
presented by each adacto makes necessary the utilization of every possible bit
of information, from every available source, bearing on the particular passage.
ln this connection it might be expected tbat some help could be got, some-
times at least, from the form or wording of the adicio, that the additions
coming from Bracton would show certain characteristics of style or phrasing
which would be lacking in addicimus from other sources lf the existence of
such peculiarities could be established, it would be of great advantage in
determining the probable authorship of doubtful passages. The subject is
important enough to demand careful attention, notwithstanding the statement
already made that addicioam from all sources are very much of a type. Itis
perfectly plain at the very beginning that no great differences in the matter of
words and expressions would normally be found in addiciaaea from different

sources. Whether Bracton or some one else did the writing, there were ,

certain legal and technical expressions which could not be dispensed with.
