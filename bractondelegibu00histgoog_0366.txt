BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

would be foolish to maintain that there were just 20 mistakes in the exemplar
of CA, and that the scribe of CA made 54 errors in copying, for that portion
of the text collated on fs. sabas. Many a variant which in the reckoning has
had to be put in the “Alone’' column may have been copied from an exemplar
which has since been lost, and the scribe of the extant copy may have been a
good copyist who faithfully reproduced a very poor exemplar. But it is
noticeable that usually the poorest manuscripts have the greatest number of
“Amnes'' and it may pretty safely be taken for granted-especially when
there are other extant manuscripts in the same line which can be used lor
comparison—that those texts which have the largest figures in the second
column were written by the more careless and less dependable scribes.
Certainly the two sets of figures give very much more than a mere indication
of the comparative value ol each scribe's exemplar, and of the accuracy and
fidelity with which he reproduced it.

Though these figures have been taken from an actual count of the variants
in the passages collated, not all of the total number ol variants have been
used. There have been omitted from the reckoning those variants which
have clearly resulted from ambiguous abbreviations, such as nivi for ubi, et for
vel, cum for tonan, debeat for deberet, the use of the singularior the plural,
etc. (See pp. 104-111 above.) Cases of inverted order of words, of mere
differences in spelling-usfodiot, fodcut-‚ of the omission of a connecting et·-
libere, (et) quiete-, of gerund instead of gerundive, have all been passed over.
(See pp. 99-104 above.) At places where there is a disagreement in regard to
the verb, several different forms of the same verb being used with about equal
authority, no count has been made. Nor is it possible to form any idea of the
correct or incorrect reading in such a case as that found on f. llab, where the
manuscripts are divided between diversitatem and varietatem, either of which
would lit the sense. In other words, ordy those variants which are clearly no
part of the original text have been counted. It may seem that so many
variants have been excepted that the figures in the¹ tables are incomplete; as a
matter of fact the total number of variants is so large that the exceptions make
but little difference in that total.

In studying these figures it should be kept in mind that, though valuable
in many respects, they can not be taken as an absolute guide. The evidence
which they lumish must be used in connection with such other information as
has been brought forward. J udged from these ligures alone, ΗΒ shows up
better than CB, and MD than MA. From other sources we know this to be
