THE ADDICIONES

refuse to receive. In nearly the same class as this latter type is the additio
which rests on the authority of some subgroup in (ΙΙ) alone.

The crucial test in nearly all cases of doubtful origin is the treatment of
an addida by (ΙΙΙ). By far the larger number of addicimaes are found in the
general run of manuscripts in both (III) and (ΙΙ). ΙΙ the manuscripts in each
of these groups were always consistent and unanimous in their acceptance of
au additio there would be little reason for doubting its right to a place in the
treatise. But frequently a few texts in one or the other of these groups—
especially in (rin-onst an martana passage which the others give. rus
brings up the same question which was raised when the collated additiones
were being considered, whether in such a case it is the manuscripts which omit
or those which give the passage that are following the tradition of their group.
The problem is complicated because in probably the greater number of cases
three of the manuscripts in (ΙΙΙ), OA, ΟΕ, LA, omit the passages from their
main text, and the position of (ΙΙΙ) must be very largely determined by MC
and OD, the latter of which can not be too readily trusted because of its
tendency to borrow additiones from (ΙΙ). It is only by a thorough discussion
of every point bearing on the treatment of the addicioaes by (ΙΙΙ), as brought
out by the facts iu the list below, that the real attitude of that group can be
correctly understood. ’

For all the passages collated, except towards the very end of the treatise,
(ΙΙΙ) was seen to be made up of OA, ΟΕ, LA, MC, OD, with PH showing a
close agreement with OD at those places in which it was collated. ML,
which is made up oia combination of sources from (ΙΙ) and (ΙΙΙ), might also
be considered in this group. But the structure of ML in one instance, and
the inaccessibility of PH in the other, remove these two manuscripts from the
present discussion. The other five manuscripts have been very closely
examined as far as the adalam are concemed. It should be kept in mind
that ΟΑ and ΟΕ lean rather towards (Ι), that OD reaches out towards the
OC side of (ΙΙ), and that MC and LA occupy a middle position. For many
parts of their text OA, ΟΕ, LA contain but comparatively few adactam
In this respect they are decidedly more like (Ι) than like (ΙΙ). Both MC and
OD have additiones in their texts, some of them marked, and the latter
manuscript contains also considerable extraneous matter peculiar to itself
alone. Of all the manuscripts, OA and LA have the largest number of
additional passages in the margin. OA is particularly noteworthy in this
respect, for with the exception of that part of the treatise contained in six of
