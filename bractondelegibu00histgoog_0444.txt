attactos: DE LEGIBUS

meaning or import of the text As the great majority of all the case refer·
ences in the treatise go unchallenged there can not be the slightest doubt that
Bracton himself is responsible for them. The fact that similar references are
addicioues can not in any way affect Bracton’s claim to be the first writer on
English law to cite precedents of this sort. But these references in the
doubtful addicam do bear vitally on the question as to whether Bracton
really invented this method of citing precedents or merely used in his book a
custom which was common to the legal usage of his time. What was his
object in making references to these cases? We ean hardly believe that he
expected his readers to look them up by referring to the rolls. Was he doing
it because it had already become customary for lawyers to support their own
contentions on a point of law by referring to cases already tried or to the
decisions of great judges like Pateshull and Raleighl In other words, was
there such a generally well-understood way of citing cases of a former time that
men after Bracton who wrote marginal addicioaes in copies of his book natur-
ally all used the same method, or were they following the fashion set by
Bracton? We have already seen that while there is an abundance of cases,
not mentioned in the treatise‚ in the margins of many manuscripts, these
references are usually of an indefinite character, made chiefly for the annota-
tor’s own use and not at all in the usually exact form of Bracton’s citations.
Not all of Bracton’s references are of the exact kind which refer definitely to a
particular record. Some of thern are of the sort that might easily have been
made from memory‚ as will be seen later. But taken as a whole, Bracton’s
citations differ materially in form from most of those made by later annotators.

While no citations similar in all respecta to Bracton’s can be found in the legal
¹ writings from the age immediately following him, there is abundant evidence
to prove that the citing of precedents was common in the years which mark the
end of Hemy Ill’s reign and the beginning of that of his son. In his Magna
Summa, which was probably written between the years lato-1275, Hengham
refers to judgments of Henry de Bath (it is possible that Bracton is meant)
and Rnger de Turkilby. Rulings of these same two judges are to be found
also in Brevia Placitata‚¹ which in all probability comes from about the same
time as the Magna Samma. Another tract from this same general periodis
the Casus Placitoram or Cos de Jageoaenr as it is called in some of the

¹Thua in the Lambeth MS. 499, in the “defense’' of the “Pone” ia, “Solum Sire B. de Turkilby c H.
de Baa lem deit dire quil en fu testmoiue par la raison ke sou pene ua savoit lequel il ioiudreit bataille ou

gruunt asaiae.” This same pusage is found at the same placa iu Br00io Plocitoto iu the Cambridge Univeraity
Library MS. Ee, 1, 1.
