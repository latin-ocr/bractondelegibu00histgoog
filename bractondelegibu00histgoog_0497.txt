 

THE ADDlClONES

F. 4141),11. 37-43. Ut tephritis. . . . uel non. Omitted in LA, LF
(in part). Regular in manuscripts generally, including ML. OC marks

additional. Certainly from Bracton, probably not an addicio.
F. 416. A passage not in V. Sed nen refert utrum. . . . sit bastardia

(admota causa). Inserted aster respondeat, 1. 33, in ΜΕ, ΜΗ, ΜΜ, Ρ; atter
incertitudo, l. 31, in CF, and OC, MD (which mark additional); aiter cognitio,
l. 33, in MC, LA. Omitted in OA, OB, OD, MA, ΜΒ, MF, MG, ML,
MN, Y. This should at least be kept in the list of doubtful passages It may
have come from Bracton.

F. 417, 11. 13-33. This list of names, though omitted in OA, ΟΕ, MG,
and other manuscripts in (ΙΙ), is given regularly in OB, OC, OD, MA, ΜΒ,
MC, MD, ΜΕ, ΜΗ, ΜΜ, MN, ML, MF, CF, LA, P, Y. Its right to a
place in the treatise is therefore assured.

F. 417,11. 37-41. Et quod assisa. . . . Norlington. Regular in CM, .

ΜΕ, ΜΗ, ΜΜ, Ρ. Inserted aster facienda, 1. 33, in MC, LA. Omitted
in OA, OB, OC, OD, ΟΕ, OF, MA, ΜΒ, MD, MF, ML, MN, ΟΕ, Y, MG.
This case is cited again on f. 4131), where it occurs not in an addieio but in
the main text. See Note Boolc, case 1780. The Note Boolc reads, Juratores
dieunt quod Jeruasius et Rogerus non sunt propinquiores heredes quia nati
fuerunt in adulterio ante matrimonium. Et ideo cmsideratum estquod nihil
capiam, etc. The passage in the text on f. 4181), reads, etde quibus dicerunt
iuratores quod bastardi fuerunt, quia nati ante matrimonium, et procedit assisa
mortis antecessoris in cuma regis. The amicto on f. 417 reads, et uhi iuratadinit
quod non fuerunt heredes propinquiores, quia nati fuerunt in adulterio ante
matrimonium. The words of the additio are certainly more like those of the Note
Book than are those in the authentia passage in the text. Both passages in the
treatise bring out the point emphasized by the case and the marginal note in the
Note Boolc, that a lay court has the power to determine special bastardy. In
content, then, this addicis has everything necessary to recommend it es one of
Bractou’s own. But the fact that so many of the manuscripts repudiate it should
make us hesitate to accept it too readily on that basis. The possibility of some
one other than Bracton having used the Note Book for purposes of citation has
to be taken into consideration in a case of this sort. We are not justified in
doing more than labelling this additio doubtful asto authorship.

F. 4171). A passage not in V. Et ideo in nullo casu valet. . . . patris.
Inserted meretricantur, l. 30, in OA, LA, MC, CF, MG, ΟΕ, and OC,
MD (which mark additional); aster obscure, 1. 30, in ΜΕ, ΜΗ, ΜΜ, Ρ.
