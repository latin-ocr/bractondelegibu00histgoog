THE ADDICIONES

the main text, or why ΟΕ should give regularly what LA has in the margin
and OA omits, or why OA and ΟΕ should omit what LA has regularly,
or LA omit what OA and ΟΕ have regularly, or OA have regularly what
ΟΕ and LA omit, are questions which can not be answered because
of the failure of these manuscripts to follow any apparent rule or reason
in their omission of additional passages. Some of the discrepancies may be
out and out omissions due to scribcs’ errors. Perhaps even more of the
omissions may be due to the fact that some man for whom a new text was
being copied may have ordered some passages in the exemplar to be left
out. Yet it should be said that in any manuscript the omitted passages are of
so many different types and kinds that it would be very difficult to discover
on what basis any such selection of passages to be omitted was made. But it Ι
is perfectly certain that OA, ΟΕ, and LA all belong in (ΙΙΙ), and it is far
easier to accept their contradictions in the omission of odda'cv‘onca as an
unsolved problem than to explain the tradition of (Ι) as anything other than
an older text tradition than that of (ΙΙΙ). It goes without saying that no
assumption of a single original with all Bracton’s additions in its margin will
ever explain the contradiction of omissions in OA, ΟΕ, and LA. If any one
of them is following such an original in the matter of additiones the other two
most decidedly are not. ln all probability no one of these manuscripts is at
best nearer than grandchild (and more likely great-grandchild) to the original
copy. They may all have had a common ancestor which was not that
original. It looks as if in the case of each one of them there had been made
somewhere back in the line an attempt to free the main text of a large part of
the additional matter. But we can not be sure of this.

One point which is rather noteworthy in connection with these three
manuscripts is that no one of them makes use of the word ADDICIO or a
similar designation to mark the character of such additional passages as it
gives. MC and OD, the other two manuscripts in (ΙΙΙ), make use of such
marks. We might reasonably expect any manuscript which was closely
following Bracton's own copy to do this. For this ADDICIO isin very
general use, not by a few manuscripts only, or by any one group‚ but by
manuscripts in all groups. The widespread practice osthus marking additional
matter would indicate an early origin. It is certainly as early as the tradition

of the nucleus of (Ι). It would seem to have begam with Bracton himself,
for it is difficult to explain its occurrence in all lines except on the ground that
it existed in the common orign'nal of thern all. And Bracton was the one who
