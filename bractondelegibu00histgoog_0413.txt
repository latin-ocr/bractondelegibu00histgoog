THE ADDICIONES

representatives which contained one or more of the three additional passages.
In the addim on f. 3, sub-groups appeared for (ΙΙΙ) and (ΙΙ), to both of which
traditions the passage equally belonged. These facts would seem to prove
that when au additio comes down through a group—iu contradistinction to
having been copied into some members of that group from other groups—it
will acquire distinctive readings in the individual members of the group‚ so
that the sub-groups represented by variants in the addwio correspond to those
in the main text. As was pointed out when the choice of manuscripts was
being considered, (1) represents an older text form than (ΙΙΙ), and (ΙΙΙ) than
(ΙΙ). Coupled with what has just been said, this makes plain a 'number of
points. In general, we cau be fairly certain that any addicio which is vouched
for by all three of the principal groups is one of the earliest set of additional
passages and from Bractou’s pen. An additio which rests upon the authority
of the combined traditions of (ΙΙΙ) and (ΙΙ) will usually belong to a somewhat
later set of additiones, but will probably have corne from Bracton. Au addida
which has the support ol only a single one of these groups, be it (Ι), (ΙΙ), or
(ΙΙΙ), may be either early or late, but can hardly have come from the same
source as the main text. In making these general rules we have worked on
the assumption made on p. 302 ι above, that the prototype of (Ι) was a
manuscript taken from an unfinished copy of the treatise‚ aud that (ΙΙΙ)
represents the more complete work as lest by the author. This adelicia on
f. lolb fumishes just the kind of evidence to support such a contention. The
mere fact that there are addicionea in the traditional text of (Ι) does away with
the idea that this group represents only a text spnrng from the same stock as ⁰
(ΙΙ) or (ΙΙΙ) from which all additional passages have been carefully debarred.
It is at least more than that. N or is there the slightest chance that the
addida on f. lolb was ever a portion of the main text from which it might
have become detached. The fact that the different groups assign it to three
different positious in the text, while two of the manuscripts keep it in the
margin, proves conclusively that it is a typical “floating” addicio. More
addicimus of this type will be found in the list below. Their presence helps
very decidedly to streugthen the claims which have been put forth for (Ι).
And these statements hold true in spite of the fact that for fs. 45-151, group
(Ι) gives in the text practically all the addidooea. The significance of this will
be fully discussed below.

The evidence to be derived from the collation of fs. 1791)-180 is somewhat
contradictory as far as the main text is concemed. But the addicio found in
