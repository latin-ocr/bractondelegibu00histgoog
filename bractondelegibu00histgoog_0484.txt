BBAOTON: DE LEGIBUS

manuscripts examined do or do not contain this passage is not decisive enough
to determine its origin one way or another. The collation ol the texts ol OD,
MC, ΟΕ, will probably show whether they have derived this passage from (ΙΙ)
or represent for it a tradition in (III). For the present it must be regarded as
an additio ol doubtful authorship, with the weight of evidence rather inclining

towards Bracton as the writer.

F. 2771), end of sect. 2. Ut deitiuere. . . . filio Bcdalplri. Begular in
OD, MC. Inserted aster mam, l. 18, in OF3 aster Faber, 1. 14, in OC, OG.
Marginul in OA. Omitted in OB, MA, ΜΒ, MD, ME, OM, CB, CM, LA,
Y. Twice‚ elsewhere, Bracton cites this case, f. 2001) and f. 421, each time in
the main text, and in the latter instance in almost the same words as in this
citation. The case itself is to be found in the Note Boole, No. 1411, and
Appetitas to Vol. III, No. 8. But the manuscripts vouch for this particular
additio far less consistently than we could wish, and on the basis of their
evidence we are not justified in saying anything more positive than that the
passage may have come from Bracton.

Β. 2771), ll. 2827. Sed contrarium . . .. nam. Regular in OD.
Inserted atter accessione, l. 82, in OF. Marginal in OA, CA (both of which
have the date cclii). Omitted in OB, OG, OM, MA, ΜΒ, MC, MD, ΜΕ,
CB, CM, LA, Y. This citation is not at all in Bracton’s customary form.
The passage is supported by (II) ÷0D and repudiated by (1) ÷ (ΙΙΙ).
Bracton can not be considered the author.

Fs. 278Β2791), 11. 25-80. Item sicut oon. . . . propinquiores. Regular
in OD, OC, OM, ΜΒ, MC, MD, ME, and OB, MA, MN, Y (which mark
as additional). Inserted alter assatur, l. 81, f. 277, in CB3 alter sect. 8,
f. 278, in OF, CA (marks additional); aster contra masam, l. 28, f. 2781), in
OG. Marginal in OA. Omitted in LA. There can be no doubt that this
has come from Bracton. It shows, too, that LA may omit an additional
passage which is clearly from Bracton. Therefore, an omission by LA in this
portion of the treatise should not count strongly against an adelicia

F. 280, ll. 5-8. Idemdici. . . . ceutria Regulsr in OD, OM, MC, LA,
ME. Inserted aster corsauguinitate, l. 24, f. 2781), in cm aster potuit, l. 45,

Omitted in OA, OC, OD, OF, MA, ΜΒ, MC, MD, ME, CB, LA, Y, and
manuscripts generally.
