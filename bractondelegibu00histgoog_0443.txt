 

THE ADDICIONES

passage written in the main text in 1250 might have quite a different ring
from that of an additio written fifteen years later.

Addicioaes which have resulted from attempts to keep the treatise up
to date are invariably from sources other than Bracton. The tremendous
changes in the law introduced by Edward I seem to have affected the Bracton
manuscripts at once. A very considerable portion of the total marginalia in
these manuscripts has to do more or less directly with the legislation of that
reign. We might expect that much the same sort of effect would have been
produced upon Bracton by the Provisions of Westminster‚ if not by the
Statute of Marlborough. But in his amidam he nowhere seems to have
made any effort to correct what the events of later years made either historical
or legal anachronisms.

A question arises as to whether or not there is any special significance in
the Plus with which some of the adactam in MC are marked. The word
itself tells plainly enough that the passage to which it refers has been taken
into a text which did not originally contain it. But whether these additions
were made by the scribe of MC itself, or by one or more of the copyists of the
ancestors of MC, it is impossible to tell. In several places, MC expressly
states that a particular passage is not found in another, or the other, book (pl ·
continetur io isto libro quam ia alio), but in every instance the statement has
become a part of the body of the text, which is hardly the natural place for
such a remark and leads us to infer that the copyist of MC has incorporated an
explanatory side note found in the margin of an exemplar. Whatever its
origin, the word is attached to passages of such varying degrees of authenticity
that it can not be used as a safe guide to the authorship of the additiones which

it marks. The most reasonable explanation of its occurrence in MC is that it ’

was used by some scribe to denote, indiscriminately‚ both passages taken from
the margin of one manuscript into the main text of another, and passages in
one manuscript which were found, on comparison, to be lacking in another.

A point of considerable actual importunae, and of even greater interest,
centers about the references to cases. In the printed book there are about
five hundred of these references The manuscripts show that some seventy
of them are additiones. Of these seventy some are undoubtedly from Bracton
himself, some are clearly from other sources, but the majority must be put
among the list of passages of doubtful origin. Ordinarily these case addicares
are not especially important except as they form parts of longer addicimus.
At the best they are references to records and do not in any way effect the
