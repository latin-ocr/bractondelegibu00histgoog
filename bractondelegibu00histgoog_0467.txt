reads, ucat de uic. et olias. Item. Marginal in OA. Omitted in OD, LA,
ΜΕ. See Note Book, I, 1693 III, 522, n. 1. Undoubtedly from Bracton.

OD, OE, OF, MA, ΜΒ, MC, MD, ΜΗ, LC, ME, ΟΕ, B(marks additional).
Marginal in OA, LA, W. See case 943 in Note Book. Another of Bracton's
additions.

F. 142Ι), ΙΙ. 40-42. Ut dc itinere . . . . atatem. Regularin OD. Inserted
aster multemium, l. 44, in OB, MA, ΜΒ, ΟΕ; aster patrium, l. 46, in OF, ΟΕ,
MC, MH, ΜΕ, W; aster annorum, l. 45, in OC. Omitted in LA, OG.
Marginal in OA. This case is not found in the Note Book. The citation
must, however, be assigned to Bracton.

F. urb, 11. al-ao. Sicut coram . . . . perdonavit motem. 'Regum in
OB, OD, OM, MA, MB, MC, MD, ΟΕ. Inserted aster enit, Ι. 20, in OF,
ΟΕ, ΜΗ, LC, LD, B(marks additional). Omitted in OC, LA. Marginal
in OA. Though the case itself is not found in the Note Book, and the citation
is not as definite as those usually made by Bracton, the way in which this
addicto is supported by the manuscripts compels us to accept it as one made
by the author of the treatise.

Fs.147-147b‚ll.aa-42. Adchtane. Raptus mulier. . . . coomtudt'uaota
hahetur. Regular in OB, OM, MD, MA, MB, ΜΕ, ΟΕ, LC. Inserted
alter necessitate, l. 44, f. 148, in OD; aster cap. XXVIII, f. 148b, in OC, OF,
MH, LD. Marginal in OA, CB. Omitted in W, Y, MC, LA. CM leaves
for it a space of nearly a column after sect. 1, cap. XXIX, f. 148b, and gives
the passage in the first column of its next page. This additio does not always
occur in the form iu which it is found in V. The evidence at hand is not
quite sufficient to settle the question of its authorship. It should be regarded
as of doubtful origin until the collation of it has furnished additional informa-
tion, in the shape of variants, bearing on its source.

F. 150, ll. 17-18. Quiasic. . . . huiuamodi. Regularin OA, OB, MA,
MB, MD, ΟΕ, CM. Marginal in Y. Omitted in LA. It is difficult to
explain these unusual omissions which occur from timeto time in good
manuscripts like Y and LA. This sentence sounds like au asterthought; it
must 'be attributed to Bracton.

F. 150, 142428. Qut autem. . . . mame deberet. Regular in OB,
OC, MA, MB, MC, MD, CB, CM. Inserted after interficerint, l. 22, in
