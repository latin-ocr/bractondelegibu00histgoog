PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

are examples of the occasional and unusual variant. They go contrary to the
general trend of agreement. This type of variantis best explained on the basis
of corrections having been made in an exemplar. In this case, and at this
place, no matter what may prove to be the relationship of these same manu·
scripts later in their texts, it is evident that a common ancestor of one group
was influenced, through comparison and copying, by a common ancestor of
another. So many other variants mark out the regular line of agreement
that we can feel sure of it in spite of these results of seemingly casual
corrections.

Fs. lot-loab-MM not collated. MF and P are in a pair group in (ΙΙΙ)
with MC, LA, Y, OG. OM, HA, W, form. one sub-group in (Ι) and Ml,
LC, CM, another, the latter combining with MA, ΜΒ, MD. ME, MH,
CC, LB, form a subgroup in (ΙΙ), uniting in a larger group with OF, MG,
MK, CB, ΗΒ. Here the split in (IV) is very noticeable, its members being
found in all of the three principal groups and following five different branch

lines—LT is in another branch of (ΙΙ) from that in which ME, CC, MH,
belong. Moreover, none of these manuscripts are found in the same large groups

as on fs. nabat. ΜΕ, CC, P, MF, have gone into different larger divisions
from (I), ME and CC keeping together though separated from P. OM and

HA have kept together, though MH and CM have separated. For this
passage there are only a few variants which could in any way connect these
scattered groups. Group (ΙΙ) which includes ME, MH, CC, has et igitur for
eiigitur, this being the reading also of (OM, HA, W), (ΜΓ, P), ML, CE.
Where this same group (ΙΙ) has ct volontate for et in voluntate, OM, HA, Ml,
LC, P, likewise omit the in. ME, MH, CC, have occasione for actione, OM,
ΜΙ, LC, CM, agreeing with them. Many theoretical explanations might be
offered as to why these particular manuscripts have these particular variants.
But if it is to be explained otherwise than on the ground of coincidence, if in
these variants there is to be found a connection existing between the various

members of (IV) at this place, the fact of importunae will continue to ¹

be that these chance agreements are the result of corrections made in an
exemplar.

vs. alanna-For comparison with the smaller groups at other places it
may be pointed out that the sub-groups of (IV) are (ΟΜ, ME, MH, P, CM),
(ME, MH, CM), (ΜΗ, CM), (LC, W). Of manuscripts which at one time

or another have been more or less closely associated with members of (IV),
HA and MF go with (Ι), and CC with (ΙΙ).
