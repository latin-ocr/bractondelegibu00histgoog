BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

number of variants a large proportion are due, either directly or indirectly, to
the widespread use of abbreviations by the scribes; the true significance of the
different variants it is not possible to judge until the part played by the abbre-
viations is understood. From what is now to be said of the abbreviations it
will become apparent that words which are quite unlike one another when
written out in full may look almost the same in their abbreviated form3 and
that many variants which appear at first sight to be quite distinct and determi-
native, may be found, when their origin is studied‚ to have come from one and
the same abbreviation, and to be, therefore, of a non-determinative character.

To say that the text of the Bracton manuscripts is usually very fully abbre-
viated is to give no adequate impression as to just what the situation is in this
respect. In the first place, there is no uniformity whatsoever in this matter,
the difference between those texts which have the least abbreviations and those
which have the most being very wide. In general, those written in book
hand, where the scribe was often anxious to make as fine appearing a piece of
work as possible, show fewer abbreviations than those written in court hand.
In the latter the work was sometimes of so hurried and careless a nature that
the abbreviations were multiplied to an excessive number, even the usual
abbreviations being yet further abbreviated. Such a process led to the forma·
tion of undecipherable or ambiguous abbreviations, which other scribes-some
of whom attempted to extend the abbreviated word in the light of the con·
text-read and interpreted indifferent ways. Moreover, we get a decided
lack of agreement among the scribes as to the way in which the abbreviations
of many of the different words should be made. Though there is in all the
hands a more or less uniform way of making a number of the more common
abbreviations, in the wider application of the abbreviated forms the individual
copyist allowed himself such leeway that there is sure to be found in the work
of each penman a set of abbreviations peculiar to himself alone. Doubtless
one reason why one scribe so osten misunderstood the abbreviations used by
another lay in the fact that the first was in the habit of making his abbreviation
for a certain word very like the abbreviation made by the other scribe for quite
adifferent word. Thus it comes about that in deciphering the abbreviations
it is not possible to lay down hard and fast rules which must always hold, or to
say that the same word will always be abbreviated in the same way, or even
that a particular combination of marks and letters must always mean a certain
word. Only a knowledge of the peculiarities of each scribe will enable one to
correctly extend his shortened forms in every instance, and even that
