 

THE ADDICIONES

aster pertineat ad regem, reading at the end of the addicto, 01100. Remittere
conpareat obligare 10000 potest et macrore ac 0000. Item ..... This is a
very old addc-io, but we can not be at all certain as to its authorship.

F. 081),1. 20. 10000101ον. . . ,00100001 Regular in OC. Used asa
rubrio in ΜΙ. Omitted in OA, OB, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΟ, MD, ME, MN, MG,
ΟΜ, LA, Y. Clearly no part of the main text.

F. 401), ll. 7-0. Illud 10100). . . . obligare potest. Regularin OC, MD,
MG, CM, ΜΙ. ΜΒ has as rubrio. Omitted in OA, OB, MA, MN, MC,
ΟΕ, LA, Y. This can hardly be from Bracton.

F. 401), 11. 11·20. Et 000 animo. . . . 00010 asna. Regular in OD.
Inserted aster sect 1, 1091), in ΜΙ; aster tenementum, l. 20, 140, in OC
(marks additional), OF (marks additional), OM, and MG, MH, LB, ΟΜ, all
of which mark as additional; aster 000, l. 9, f. 40, in MC (marks plas); atter
omanadum, 1. 26, 140, in MD. Marginal in LA. Omitted in OA, OB,
MA, ΜΒ, ME, MN, ΟΟ, ΟΕ, Υ. Before deciding on the authorship of this
passage, it will be well to await such evidence as the collation of manuscripts
in different lines may bring out. It is· clearly an early addieio, possibly from
Bracton himself.

F. 41, ll. 10-22. Item 01100000. . . . vel 000 procedat. Regular in OD
and OC, B (mark additional), MD, MG, MH, ΟΜ. Insert aster 000000 salo,
l. 20, 1411), ΜΟ (marks plus). Marginal in LA. Omitted in OA, OB,
MA, ΜΒ, ME, ΜΝ, ΟΟ, ΟΕ, Y. This additio rests upon the same basis as
the one immediately preceding, as far as its origin may be judged from the
available data. If the collation which is to follow shows subgroups to exist
for it in (II), and distinct group characteristica in the manuscripts of group
(III), it in all probability belongs to Bracton. Otherwise it must be put in
the list of doubtful passages.

F. 41, ll. 22-46. Anaia-itur rea. . . . alto proprio. Regular in OD.
Inserted aster arat traditio, 1. 18, f. 40, in MC (which marks the whole of
sect. awith plus, and inserts at this point); after convaleat-tt, l. 40, 1. 40, in
OM, MH, ΟΜ, and OF, MG, LB (which mark additional); aster paral ias,
l. 00, 140, in MD, OC (marks additional). Marginal in LA. Omitted in
OA, OB, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΝ, ME, ΟΕ, Υ.

Fs. 41-41b, ll. 40-2. Attoraatas faerit . . . . tempore, etc. These lines
have been given separately because they are clearly additional and are treated
differently by different manuscripts. They are omitted by OA, OB, MA,
ΜΒ, ΜΝ, MD, ME, ΟΒ, Υ. In some manuscripts they are made part 01
