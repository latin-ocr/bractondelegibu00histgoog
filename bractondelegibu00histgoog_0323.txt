PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPI'S

we are able in a broader way to determine about what position each
manuscript as a whole should occupy. The practical side 01 this matter 01
pedigree is in the choosing of those manuscripts which best represent the

different text traditions. And this choice, in spite of confusing contradictions,
can be made.

As the three longer passages which have been collated give a better basis

on which to work than the shorter, it will be well to consider these longer
portions first, and then compare the shorter sections with them. It has
already been acknowledged that the shorter passages are not always long
enough to meet the requirements for sufficient information on every manu-
script. The question may well be asked as to why, when this was discovered,
the passages were not extended to meet the requirements. The answer must
be that at the beginning it was not possible to foresee just what was needed
in the way of variants. The actual value of any one of the shorter passages
could not be known until the collation as a whole had been finished. It was
then too late to visit again the homes of all the manuscripts, especially of those
single copies in the less accessible places So the shorter collations, which
indeed are valuable in themselves for the most part, are forced in away to
depend upon the longer. When there are not sufficient data in the shorter
passages to determine satisfactorily the position of any particular manuscript,
it will be necessary to decide what place that manuscript should occupy on the
basis of the evidence in the longer passages. Inasmuch as there is always the
possibility that those portions ofa codex which fall within the longer passages
may be from a different exemplar from that from which the portions containing
the shorter passages were taken, this plan can not be entirely satisfactory.
Nevertheless it can be used to good advantage. And as a matter of fact, a
comparison 01 the shorter passages with the long passage nearest to them does
bring out points which are not so apparent in the shorter passages themselves.
As an example of how such a comparison may show what the shorter passages
do not even suggest, we may take the following. In the collation for f. 118
Y is seen to agree with MC and LA. OC and OG also agree. In the
collation for f. laab there is no evidence of relationship between MC, LA, YÍ¾
but the passage in OG, which is found out 01 place in the second part of that
manuscript, goes over from the OC line to that 01 Y. In the long passage on
fs. 161-1621) the text 01 OG is found in portioris in the two parts 01 the codex,
that in the first part agreeing as on f. 118 with OC, and thatin the second
part continuing to show a relationship with Y, as on f. 1321). In other words
