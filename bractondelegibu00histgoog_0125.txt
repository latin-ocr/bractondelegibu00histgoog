PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

knowledge is at times not sufficient to penetrate the ambiguity surrounding
some of the abbreviations.

At this point it is necessary to consider to what extent the copyists of
the Bracton manuscripts may have extended words abbreviated in their
exemplars, or have abbreviated words written out in full. Ordinarily we work
on the assumption that the medieval scribe copied his model, in so far as he
could make it out, with a mechanical and almost absolute faithfulness. Usually
we do not expect to find him making corrections or emendations or alterations 01
any kind. But a study of the Bracton manuscripts shows plainly that at least
sconsiderable number of the men who copied them did not always adhere to
an exact reproduction of their model in every particular.¹ We have already
noticed the differences existing in the external features of the manuscripts,
differences so great as to preclude the possibility of the scribes having followed
even a general arrangement 01 divisional parts, We have seen, also, that some
of the copyists changed the order of words to suit their own ideas of style;
that some preferred siue to vel in certain connections. Oiten we find them
using other words by preference, such as sedicet for videlicet, or enim for autem.
Sometimes they make more out and out alterations in the text, as where the
scribe 01 Edward’s day-almost unconsciously‚ we may suppose-inserts an
Edwardas for the original Hennae 01 some writ.² But it was in the matter
of abbreviating and extending that they allowed themselves the greatest liberty
of making changes.⁸ Not once or twice only, but hundreda and hundreds of
times we come upon such words as the usual tera, dha, nmag, written tene·
orento, 1111101ςί00, bonag-fa in some manuscripts, and tenementis, (1111010011,
1100103111, 111 others. In fact, it 0011 be put down as a rule, that where some of
the manuscripts vary between the singular and plural of the same word in
this way, the majority 01 the texts will be found to have the ambiguous
abbreviation, which is the same for both singular and plural. What this
abbreviating and extending can do in the way of producing variants is well seen
in the collation of f. 13211, where in thirty-five manuscripts the same word is

² When 1110 scribe 01 MA writes por ipsum 0010110101· per ipsam omnifariam (1. 4131)), 110 know 11101,
01011 though 110 may have attempted 10 extend an abbreviation, 110 10 doing his work 111001101110111111 and is not
thinking of the sense of what 110 is writing. On tho other hand, we lind Mss. in which 1110 scribe hasappar·

1101 treated their originale in the same ways some have copied machanioelly‚ others bava 1101.

the chartaria sect. ὀ, 1. stab (cosseted below), CH uses only the following lettera witha few simple abbreviation
