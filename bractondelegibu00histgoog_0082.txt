Such is the frama on which Bracton’s book was built. Any mere outline
of this sort can take into consideration only the major divisions; details have
to be avoided. The object aimed at here has been to reproduce some such
plan as the author may have used in writing his book.⁴ There has been no
attempt to make a detailed analysis of the Dc Legibus, and consequently
much has been lest out which might have been inserted. The scheme is
sufficiently full, however, to show that Bracton went about his task in a very
methodical way. From a study of it we are able to compreheud the meaning
of his “sub ordine titulorum et paragraphorum.”' It is evident‚ also, that
while a work developed on such well-defined lines does not coll for a further
arrangement by books, it readily lends itself to a variety ,of arrangements
because oi the large number of points of natural division which it contains.
The marvel is not that there are so many different systems of division to be
found in the codices, but that there are not more. In leaving this subject,
now that the old arrangement by books has been repudiated, it is perhaps not
out of place to say a lew words in regard to the system of divisional arrange-
ment which will be used in the new edition. As it would be inexpedient to
attempt to use for page headings any such varying subdivision of subjeets as
the outline given above contains, the main division and the principsl
subdivisions will have to be noted at the beginning of each new portion of text
to which they apportem, and the larger subject under immediate discussion be

¹ Between aa aud bb might be inserted “de summonitionibus.”
² Between cc aud dd might be inserted “derisu faciendo.”

⁸ De Exceptiouibus has as its principal subdivisions, de exceptionibus contra iurisdictione, de exceptioni·
bus contra personam iusticiarii, de exceptionibus contra breve, de exceptione bastardiae, de exceptionibus
competentibus tenenti ex persona petentis (exceptiones peremptoriae et dilatoriae), de exceptionibus ques oom-
petunt tenenti ex persona propria, de exceptionibus quae competent tenenti ex ipse re, de exceptionibus
variis-ex taciturnitate, finis lacti, de deiectu probationis, etc.

⁴ lt is hard to believe that the first drstt ol Bractou’s outline could have been as complete es this.
