THE ADDlClONES

come into a single group and are closely related. The relationship of OC and
MD is easily explained, for by this time we have found out enough to be
positively certain that MD, though belonging regularly in (1), has derived
additional passages and a great many corrections from a manuscript closely
akin to OC. But did OD get the additio from some text in the line of OC,
or vice versa? In other words, was this passage originally in the text tradition
represented by group (ΙΙΙ), or has the single individual in that group which
gives it derived it from a manuscript in (llll It has already been pointed out
that in a way OC stands in an intermediate position between (111) and (ΙΙ),
so that theoretically at least there is the possibility of an addicto coming from
(ΙΙΙ) into (ΙΙ) through the medium of some ancestor of OC. But this is not
an addicto common to (ΙΙΙ) as a group. We should not expect to find it in
OA because this portion of the text of the Digby manuscript is in one of those
quires lacking in marginalia And this part of ΟΕ does not generally have
uddieioaes either in the text or in the margins. But MC and LA usually give
the additional passages upon which (ΙΙΙ) as a group agrees, and we should
expect one or the other of them to contain this passage if it had originally been
a part of (111’s) text tradition. From one source or another has come
information which makes it plain that OD, either of itself or through its
exemplar, has taken into what was primarily a good text in (ΙΙΙ) not a few
extensive passages of extraneous matter, even having references to the statutes
of Edward 1. Where OD got these passages is not evident‚ but it is very
plain that the copyist who burdened the good text which OD at bottom
represents with some of the other interpolated passages would not have
hesitated to add this eddium to a text which did not originally contain it. We
can be certain that the adacto did not come into (ΙΙ) from OD itself, for that
manuscript omits a long passage of thirteen words which is given by all the
other manuscripts which have the additio. In addition to this some of the
variant readings in OD are of a sort which suggests that it does not give the
traditional text of the additional passage. When everything is taken into
consideration it has to be admitted that while positive proof is lacking, the whole
weight of probability is on the side of OD having derived this additio from
some manuscript in (ΙΙ). This passage must therefore be regarded as one
peculiar to a single group of manuscripts, and that a group which contains the
largest amount of interpolations, and one which is, all things considered, least
representative of the original De Legibus. Under the circumstances one can
hardly grant this passage a place in the treatise, even though it occurs in
