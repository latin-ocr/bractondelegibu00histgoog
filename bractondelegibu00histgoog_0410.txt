BRACI‘ON: DE LEGIBUS

twenty-one οΙ the manuscripts. In the matter of additiones as in that of
actual text readings, when (Ι) and (ΙΙΙ) combine against (ΙΙ), the latter,
except in exceptional circumstances, must yield.

With the additio on f. 32b is to be compared that which comes on Ι. 33
(and in V is repeated on Ι. aab). Both passages occur in nearly the same
manuscripts. The later addicis is omitted in those three manuscripts MF,
ML, X, which in the earlier were seen to follow a tradition different from that
οΙ their texts. OC, OD, MD, again show the same relationship as for the
addida on Ι. 321), but now OD has the passage in the margin instead οΙ in the
body οΙ the text. This is yet another reason why it is hard to believe otherwise
than that OD or its immediate ancestor derived both these addidonca from
’ some near relative οΙ OC, in which they had already become incorporated as
part of the text. ME and Y have the passage in the margin, each following
the tradition οΙ a different sub-group of (ΙΙ) and showing not at all the same
relationship as for their texts proper. OG and LB, which did not give the
addicio on f. aab, have this passage and follow regularly the same lines of
¹relationship as for the main text. On p. 252 above are shown graphically all
these changes in relationship. Even more than the passage on Ι. aab this

addieio is seen to rest upon the authority of group (ΙΙ) alone, and to lack all
sanction from either (Ι) or (111). This fact is all the more striking because

the passage occurs in twenty-three οΙ the forty manuscripts in which this
portion of the treatise is found. It fumishes good proof of the futility of
basing an estimate οΙ the value of any addida, or hazarding a guess as to its
probable origin, merely upon the number of manuscripts which contain it.
This brings us to the “addicio de cann” on Ι. at. 'First of all should be
read what has been written in regard to this addicis on p. 252 above. The
point which stands out is this—that while the passage is found in one repre-
sentative of (ΙΙΙ), OD, and in four manuscripts whose main text follows
regularly the traditions of group (Ι), MD, ME, MF, P, all five of these
manuscripts have derived the addieio from some text in the line οΙ OC. The
collation shows that MD and OD maintain the same relationship with OC as
in the two previous ardinnae· ME, MF, P, come down the same general line
of descent. In each one οΙ these three additiones OC hasbeen constant toa
single tradition, that which it shows for the text proper. When manuscripts
from (Ι) or (ΙΙΙ) agree with OC in these passages they are representing OC's
tradition, not that οΙ their own text. Some οΙ the addiciones in the treatise
are vouched for by the combined traditions of (Ι) ÷ (ΙΙ) ·l· (ΙΙΙ), and a larger
