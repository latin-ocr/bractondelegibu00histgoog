BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

lt should, however, be said that there are certain forms of expression
which are found only in those addicimus which do not come from Bracton.
They occur at the beginning of a passage and result from the desire of the
writer to draw attention to a statement in the text rather than to explain or
amplify it. Additional passages which begin with such expressions as Nota,
Eece hie, Hoc udatur, Hoc quod dieitur, are of this sort and can be classified
at once. To the question as to whether or not there are some opening words
which in the same way indicate that an addit-io has come from Bracton, an
answer cannot so readily be given. A study of the addicimus shows at once
that while the passages may begin with almost any form of expression there
are some words, or combination of words, used so osten to introduce additional
matter that they become marked as typical. Such are Quia, Et (or Item)
notandum, Si (Cum) autem, Item, Sed revera, Eodem (Et eodem arado. The
reason for the frequent use of these words is at once apparent. They are the
words which were most likely to be used for the bringing in of additional
matter. What more natural than that the marginal explanation of a statement
in the main text should begin with a because, or thatun additional fact inserted
on the page somewhere outside of the main text should be introduced with
aad it is to denoted or aad ira therama wag? Bracton continually uses just
these expressions in the main text, but that does not mean that he alone
might use them in the additiones. Some of the additional passages which
undoubtedly come from the author begin with these words, but that is no
proof that all the addicimus which have the same form of opening come from
the same source. Some passages of very doubtful authorship begin with these
typical expressions. The evidence as a whole warns us against too readily
accepting all the additiones with these beginnings as from Bracton’s own
pen.

On the other hand, the fact that an addieio reads contrary to its associated
passage in the main text does not necessarily stamp it as of non-Bracton origin.
There is every indication that Bracton finished the main part of his work
some ten or twelve years before his death. Apparently, too, he never laid it
aside as quite finished, but kept adding to it from time to time as oppor-
tunity or inclination prompted. Most of his addicimus probably come from
this later period. This was a time of conflict and upbeaval in England. We
do not know with which of the parties Bracton sided; he may have had no

strong partisan feeling. But in such a time of intense feeling he may well
have come to alter some of his opinions. Itis quite conceivable that a
