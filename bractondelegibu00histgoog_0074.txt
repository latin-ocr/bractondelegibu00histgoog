BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS·

which has already been drawn to the reader’s attention, that the whole of this
general discussion on Aetions is made up of alternate layers of Roman and
English law.l As early as the third chapter we have one section with the
rubric “De actionibus civilibus in rem’' and another with the rubric “De
actionibus civilibus in personam.'’' But no one would maintain that it is at
this point that Bracton begins his real discourse on civil actious. Nemore
does chapter five, English law though it be, in its opening words, “Ubi
terminari debeant actiones sive placita videndum. Et sciendum quod si
actiones criminales sint, in curia domini regis debent terminari'’ mark the
place where the treatment of English criminal law begins. Let chapter five
be compared with chapter seven.⁸ One is no more taken up with English
criminal law than the other with English civil law. These two chapters are as
much spart of the general discussion of actions as any ol the Roman chapters
which precede or follow them3 the subjects which they introduce are brought
in at this time simply because they have a place in this general discussion, and
for no other reason. The subject of jurisdiction which occupies fs. 107-112
also comes naturally into this discussion, as we have seen, lor both jurisdiction
and the justices are but secondary topics under the more comprehensive
subject of “de iudiciis et iudicibus.” Even the long row of writs in the
eleventh chapter is no more out of place from the standpoint of Roman law
than the matter in regard to the king’s court and the lord’s court iu sections
two and three of chapter seven. As supporting the contentiori already made
that the division assigned to De Corona in V is the correct one,⁴ certain
passages may be cited. Bracton thought osone portion of his treatise as
devoted to criminal actions, and of this portion the subject was either De
corona or De placitis coronoe. Two sentences from different parts of the text
show this. One is “Dictum est supra de actionibus criminalibus et iniuriarum
quae personales sunt, et pertinent ad coronam domini regis” 3⁵ the other,
“Adquiritur et dominium per inventionem, ut si thesaurus inveniatur, secun·
dum quod inferius dicetur inter placita coronae.”⁸ From f. 115b on, placito
coroaoe is the guiding thought in Bracton’s mind and the topic emphasized in
