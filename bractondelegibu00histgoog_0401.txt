THE ADDICIONES

choose for omitted passages of any length. These omitted portions of text
may be sels-evident as such, especially if they come from the midst of a passage
and by their omission make nonsense. On the other hand, they are often
sentences complete in themselves, and are not necessary to the sense of that
portion of the text of which they form a part. Such a sentence omitted from
a manuscript which stood at the head ofa family would gradually corneto
assume in the descendants of that manuscript the feature of an addicis, being
omitted in some of them, written bya corrector in the margin of others, and
probably, as a result of the comparison of two or more manuscripts by some of
the copyists, found in the text of others. If this omitted sentence, as was
sometimes the case, began or ended with the same words as the sentence
which in the text immediately preceded or followed it, the similarity of words
might cause other scribes to lose their place, and so result in its being omitted
in other manuscripts outside of the line of that one which first failed to have
itas a part of the text. This would make it appear even more like an
addicta Now the manuscripts furnish us with just these conditions in actual
fact. The following may be cited as examples: F. 18, ll. 45, Oportet
qaod. . . . proprio vel aliena Here is a sentence which begins and ends with
exactly the same words as the one immediately before it. In the manuscripts
which have been examined ΜΒ and MG omit. MA has it in the margin.
OA, LA, MC, MD, ME, MN, CM, Y, have it regularly. With these facts as
evidence it at once becomes clear that this sentence was omitted by certain
' scribes who lost their place as they copied because two sentences close
together began and ended with the same words. But one who had to depend '
for his information upon MA, ΜΒ, MC, MD, MG, alone, could not definitely
determine whether this sentence was an addan or a part of the main text.
F. orb, ll. 2-5, etsie proferre. . . . per eodem vobo. Marginal in MA.
Omitted in OB, ΜΒ, MF, MN. Regular in OA, OC, ΟΕ, Υ, MC, ME,
CM, LA. From what we now know about the pedigree of the manuscripts
it is evident that this sentence was omitted in an early ancestor of the
manuscripts which make up group (Ι). But until the pedigree of these
manuscripts had been established this omission had all the appearanoes of an
addicio. F. 180, ll. 17-19, Siculam redditas. . . . dicitur pertinere. This is in
one of the twelve collated passages. Marginal in OA, LC. Omitted in OB,
OG, OM, HA, MA, ΜΒ, MD, ΜΙ, ML, CM, Y, LF, LG, ΟΕ, W. Regular
in the other twenty-five manuscripts collated. A real problem is presented
by this passage. Is itan adano, or is its omission in some manuscripts
