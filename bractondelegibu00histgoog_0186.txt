the curled aa sign take on the essential features of an ⁰3 thus q with the aa sign
above (gadas) becomes in another copy qao (q with an n above), or p with the
curled sign above (post) is thought to be primo (p with an o above).¹

ΙΙΙ. Abbreviations in which the sign used is misplaced or ambiguous.
Po with the nr sign above is ponitur or paro according as the sign is over the
nor the μ’ Α with a certain curved mark at its upper right hand extremity
israelem, withasimilar mark to the right and above it is aliua An a with
another a of a certain kind placed above in one position is alin, with an a of
another kind in another position above it is alinae.⁸ Ana may represent either
alios or aliquos, according to the position of the n and a‘ In allthese cases
the misplacement of the governing sign nr letter is an easy matter unless the
scribe exercises considerable care3 all of these words have changed places with
those abbreviated like them. Debet with a dash through the b is deberet, with
the dash over the e, detenm It is often difficult to tell for which ο1 these two
letters the dash is intended. When the scribe dispenses with the usual er sign
and uses a mere dash in place of it, we can not be sure whether his tait (with
the sign over the middle of the word) is meant for habuerit or tatuit At
times nd becomes mixed up with both aliud (a with d just above and a little
to the right) and aliquid (ad with an i above and between).⁶ In the same way
id, idern, (id witha mark through the d), and illud (i with d a little above and
to the right) are confused.⁷ The abbreviation for infra is distinguished from
that for ita by a dot on either side of the·i; if either of these dots is omitted
the longer word is quite apt to be turned into the shorter.⁸ Etiam is changed
to et by the chance omission of the simple dash above the abbreviation for et.
If ascribe forms the abbreviation for idest (a single vertical stroke with a dot
nn either side) hurriedly, without taking his pen from the page in doing it, we
get something which looks like the English letter Z, and which may easily pass

alia becomes aliqua, and vice versa.
