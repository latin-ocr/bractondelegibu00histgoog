BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

indefinite or ambiguous and a comparison necessary, it is allowed to remain in
its original form, as in the case of the ambiguous abbreviations considered on
p. 110 above. For the sake of uniformity in printing, the superimposed
forms of abbreviations have not been used, llam with tis over the last letter
being written tamin. A period instead of a dash marks the abbreviation.
Thus diss represents the same word in the manuscripts with a dash over it.

By no means all of the corrections in the manuscripts are noted in the
collation. ln the case of some copies which have been much corrected and
recorrected in several different hands, such a taslr would be exceedingly
difficult. But, apart from this, there would be no point in giving all the
corrections. Since the main purpose here is to discover the pedigree of the
individual manuscript, it is the original reading, and not the correction, which
.is important, except in so far as the correction may help to determine relation-
ship. Consequently, corrections in the texts are not noted when they are
plainly by another or later hand, or when a series of thern agree with a manu-
script in another line from that of the copy in which they occur. The
necessity which the editor of aclassical text is under of giving all such correc-
tions is not present here. Not only do a large share of the changes made in
the original texts date from a period much later than that in which any of the
extant copies were written, but the facts of relationship existing between the
many codices-with possibly two exceptions, no manuscript is the direct progen-
itor of any of the others-make it impossible that the corrections in any one of
the manuscripts should have directly affected any of the others. Usually it is
possible to tell from a change in inlr or in the handwriting the difference
between the text as first written and the correction. But sometimes the inks
have faded, and show the same shadeÍ¾ or the correction may not be of
sufficient length to prove definitely that there is any difference in the hand.
In such cases, and in every case where there is any reasonable doubt, the
correction has been noted.

Considerable space would doubtless have been saved by the use of arbitrary
signs in place of such constantly recurring words as omit, imeri, corrected to,
musore, etc. When a few chosen manuscripts, scarce in variants, are collated
for the new text such signs may be used to advantage, and the reference toa
particular word may be made by a line and not by number. But in the
present circumstances where the necessary collation of a large number of
manuscripts has fumished an almost unwieldy number of variants, and where
in places the interchange of words and phrases is well-nigh bewildering, it has
