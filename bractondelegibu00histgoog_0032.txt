large amount of marginal matter in both French and Latin, much of it
consisting of commentaries on the text.¹ In the margin of f. 62, in the same
hand as the text, is a reference to the second Statute of Westminster. Two
extensive lmunae occur in the text, one covering fs. 52b98 of the printed
Bracton‚ and the other taking in fs 101-120b. Previous to the Bracton (on
f. oo-in the old numbering 157) occurs the “Arbor Consanguinitatis,''
which follows matter headed “Placita.” The treatise on consanguinity‚
which takes up about three pages, is followed by one on affinity, which
occupies not quite a page and a half.

¹ Many of the marginal notes iu French read like passages from the Year Boolrs. They may, however,
be fictitious cases used to illustrate points. A more detailed description of thia MS. Is given in vta om
Bam (saldon Soc. Prot, IV), pp. 1916.

’ A full enumeration of the contenta of CB will be found in the Rota Series, Yaor Book 20-21 Edword 1,
pp. xi-xviii.

’Decisions gu'ven by W. de Helyun are referred to frequently. Another type of marginal note is that
found at the top of f. sib-“Item in Westmarelond sunt multi qui tenent per comagu'um et dant custodiam et
maritagium et homagium et relevant terram qui suut plenae aetatia ad valentiam terroe suae unius anni et annuus

redditus illorum vocatur cornagium.” Practically all of these notes are written in hands contemporaneous
with those which have written the text.
