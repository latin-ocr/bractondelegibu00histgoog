BRACI'ON: DE LEGIBUS

of Last Presentation. His quire came to an end in the midst of a sentence
on f. asab of V. Hand IV then began quire S of ΟΛι with the Assise Utrum
and went to the end of cap. IV, f. arrh of V, hand VI having already finished
with that folio of the exemplar which he had to use first and IV copy from
afterwards. In this case again hand IV was obliged to run over the estimated
number of folioS, and so we have quireT of OA, nine folios with a blank space
and an excised folio at the end. Alter finishing quire Τ, IV went back and
took up the copying at the point where hand V had leit it off, and wrote quire
R of OA. This time the material pretty nearly fitted the quire, only the last
quarter of apage being leit blank. Hand VI wrote the last five quires. The
vacant space at the end of quire Y would suggest that he started in with
quires Z and Aa, and then, perhaps because no one had been found to do the
work in the meantime, went back and copied quires V, X and Y.

On reading this possible, we might better, perhaps, say probable, expla-
nation of the method used in making OA, the reader will naturally ask the
question, “But why all this changing about? Why not adopt the far simpler
plan of giving to each of the copyists his work, be it a less or greater
amount, in regular orderi” As we have before pointed out, a study of the
quire arrangement in the Digby manuscript will show that at least nine scribes ’
could have worked simultaneously on the single exemplar by this simple
method of changing about. If another division, now obscured, had been
made in the quires J -Ο block, ten men could have been writing at the same
time from a single copy.² If, as we have supposed, and the appearance of OA
leads us to infer, speed of productiori was the principal thing desired, the
exemplar could not have been divided ina more skillful way. He who had
charge of the scriptorium was willing to reproduce the original codex as quickly
as he could. He would put on that work all the penmen available, more at
one tirne thanat another, presumably, but he could not tell at the beginning
just how many he might be able to use. He did not divide the exemplar into
four, or five, or six equal parts because he might be able to employ ten scribes.
What he did do was to divide the parent book in such away that one, two, or
ten men might work simultaneously, or not at the same time, with the least
amount of interference and the least waste of parchment. He had to have a
flexible scheme, and to make it flexible enough to fit the undetermined possible

¹ In LA quire P, preceded by nearly a page oi blank space, begins st the same point as quire S in OA,
but ends in f. 804, tha Action ior Dower not being omitted in LA.

⁸ lt is to be remembered that the Action ior Dower is missing in OA. This tratise was long enough
ior s quire by itseli. As to the probabis csnse of its omission in ΟΑ rra shall spark ister.
