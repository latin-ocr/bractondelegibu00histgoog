PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

V. Abbreviations of a miscellaneous character. Many variants which in
the manuscripts are only slightly abbreviated, or even written out in full, and
in their more extended form appear quite different, osten lose much of their
dissimilarity and apparent signifieance when reduced to the original shortened
forms. Thus uiator regula and domim regis approach very closely to one
another in the abbreviations dr. reg. and dai. reg.¹ That actarum should
come from vi et armis· does not seem at all remarkable when we reduce the
latter to the shortened vi 1 arm, the arnt. with a dash over the m making a
perfectly good orium, and the ÷· sign in one of its numerous forms being osten-
times like to a roughly made ei.² It requires but little more than careless
spacing and the omission of one of the contiguous o’s to tum genera actionum
in its abbreviated form in one copy into generationem in another.³ Variants
of this sort are constantly met with, and for the most part have to be put
‘among the non-determinatives the reduction to their simplest form depriving
them of their apparent individuality‚ and marking them as the mere misinter-
pretations by some scribe of the perfectly correct readings in his exemplar.
Thus when OF has the victorium just now alluded to, and MG the correct vi
et armis, this particular variant does not at all militate against the very con-
sistent evidence of agreement between these two copies based on variantsof a
more determinative type.

In these five classes will be found all the various kinds of non-determina-
tive variants But by no means all of the many abbreviations themselves have
been given under these headings There has been no attempt made to fumish
anything like an exhaustive list of the abbreviations which are to be found in
the Bracton manuscripta. The object aimed at has been to give only such an
amount of this material as is necessary to show that in working over the
collation care must be taken to determine, in so far as possible, the probable
reason for, and origin of, each variant.

In the collation itself abbreviations have been dispensed with for the most
part. Almost always the shortened forms have been extended to suit the
sense and context of the passage. When, however, the abbreviation is
