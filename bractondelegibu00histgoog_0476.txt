Inserted after erit, l. 10, f. 202, in CA; alteratam, l. 20, in Mc, LA; aster
fraudem, l. 28, in OC, MD; after restitutionem, l. 42, in OF, ΜΙ. Marginal
iu OA. Omitted in OB, MA, ΜΒ, ME, CE, Y. This passage, supported
by (ΙΙ) and (ΙΙΙ), must be attributed to Bracton.

Es. 200-2001), ll. 41-3. Cemtenerar. . . . discedendum. Regular in OD.
Inserted aster davamant, l. 27. f. 200, in OC, MD; after cansa, l. 8, f. 20011,
in OF, ΜΙ, Β (marks additional); after danaim, l. 11, f. 2001), in MC, LA.
Marginal in OA. Omitted in OB, MA, ΜΒ, ME, CE, Y. Another ease of
(ΙΙ) and (ΙΙΙ) vouching for a Bracton adelino not found in (I), CE, Y.

F. 205, ll. 15·18. Iniuste qaia . . . . iudicia. Omitted in OA, MA,
ΜΒ, MD, ME, CE, Y, CM. OB omits from the indic-io, in l. 14 to the same
word in l. 18. Marginal in LA. In spite of the fact that this passage is so
generally omitted in the manuscripts it is difficult to determine whether it is
an additio or an omission due to similarity of words. Sine iudicio occurs five
times and iudano alone twice more within the space of seven lines in the
printed text. These conditions actually invite an omission. Notice how OB
has omitted. On the other hand, the fact that LA is marginal and that MC
has the passage at a point other than that at which it occurs in V, tends to
mark it as an addicta We can not be certain of its status. Inasmuch as the
manuscripts examined thoroughly, represent groups (Ι) and (ΙΙΙ), such
insertione or omissions as might be found in the manuscripts of (ΙΙ) would
leave the matter on the same doubtful basis.

F. 206,11. 4·6. Et maltofortias . . . . eiectae. Regular in OD. ln-
serted after reticuere, l. 8, in OC, MD; aster sect. 1, l. 10, in MC. Marginal
in OA, LA. Omitted in OB, OF, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΗ, ΜΙ, CE, Y, CM. The
omission of this passage hythe representatives of (ΙΙ) and (Ι) make its author·
ship very doubtful. .

F. 207,11. 01-04. Item est . . . . dedicationem. Regular in OA, MA,
ΜΒ, Mc, OB, CE, CM, Y. Inserted at end of cap. XXVII, in LA.
Marginal in LA. Whatever the reason for LA’s irregularities may be, it is
clear that this sentence belongs in Bracton’s text.
