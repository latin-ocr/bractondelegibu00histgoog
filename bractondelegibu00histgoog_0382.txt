BRACPON: DE LEGIBUS

did not “acts of kings” (notice it is regam, not regis) appeal to Bracton
rather than “royal deeds”f This is far from being an unimportant question
when taken in connection with the addicio which immediately follows. The
authorship of the addida is in doubt; Bracton may have written it. If so, he
was at the same time in the mood to insert the ragam, for the one who wrote
the Addida de Certis was clearly of the opinion that sacto regum were not
always regia sacta in the sense that they were befitting a king.¹ Not far
along in sect. 5, f. Mb, the printed text reads, “quia non multum differt
dicere concessi quam dicere consensi.” The nucleus of (Ι) omits the first
dicere In the last sentence of the passage on f. 5b the text reads, “Nemo
quidem de factis suis praesumat disputare ..... ” The variants suggest that
the original reading for the nucleus of (Ι) atthis place was, “Nemo. . . .
disputare debet. '⁹ Significant omissions for this same group in the passage on
fs. lul-loth are, “vel pecora immitendo,” f. 161b; “armatos'’ f. 1623 “suam”
f. mab. The short passage on f. 96 has a number of variants for (Ι) which bear
directly upon the point under discussion, and show that this group is at least
preserving a very old set of readings. In the sentence, “Si autem tota dos
vacaverit, tunc infra quadraginta dies assignetur ei dos sua legittima. . . . ”‚
the legittima is omitted by those manuscripts which are consistently in (Ι). It
can not, of course, be proved that this word was not in the original draft; but
it would be very hard to find an example of a word which would more
naturally be left out of a first writing and inserted on a rereading, than
legittima in this place. A few lines further on the manuscripts which omit
legittima agree on inserting sai (“post mortem vin' sui’')‚ which is omitted in
the other texts. This must not be regarded as necessarily weakening the
arguments already brought forward. In his revision Bracton probably deleted
but few words which he had at first written. Yet some may well have been
scratched out. 1f the truth were known it might be discovered that a sai
originally written at this place was not found in the author’s revised copy.
Some allowance must always be made for the character of the variant, and aui
here is not at all of the same type as ai dc (for da) and the omission of noa two
lines further on. At the very end of this same passage is another very
possible case of the insertion of an addition by Bracton himself. (Ι) gives
what may well have been his first written words, “secundum quod inferius
dicetur inter actiones dc exceptionibus dotis,’' while the other manuscripts

1'l'he addicto begins, “Item nec scotum rogis. . . .” For a discussion of this additio see Bmotoa’a
