THE ADDICIONFs

escaped detection. In the particular block of text just mentioned many of
the addicimus are very short and not easily noticed‚ and OC has a number of
them in more than usually out of the way places. In this manuscript the
additio on f. 92 is given at a point over three folios beyond the place where
it occurs in V. But even when these occasional omissions are eouuted, the
great majority, in fact almost all, of the addicionea incorporated by (1) iu this
large section of text are so unusually well recommended as to be distinctly
noticeable in this respect

There naturally arises the query as to whether at this place (1) may not

ἐ · be giving additiones peculiar originally to (ΙΙ), which have in some way

 

become incorporated in the text of a group to which they did not at first
belong. No indication of such a thing is in any way apparent. lt should be
kept in mind thatin only a comparatively few cases is the aedicio long
enough to yield on collation a workable number of determinative variants.
Several addr'ciortes have been collated for this portion of text; they do not
reveal anything which suggests a borrowing by (Ι) from (ΙΙ). In fact,
instead of showing any tendency to agree with (ΙΙ), the manuscripts in (1)
split off into the same sub-groups for the amiciores as for the main text.
This means, of course, that these addim have been in (Ι) from the time
when it began to develop as a group by itself‚ and this antedates the forma-
tion of (ΙΙ). Of further significance iu this connection is the omission made
by (Ι) οη f. 45b. Fisteen manuscripts representing four sub-groups iu (Ι),
four subgroups in (ΙΙ), and four of the five manuscripts in (ΙΙΙ) have been
compared. The passage is found in all the representatives of (ΙΙ), which
assign it to three different places. This indicates that it goes pretty well back
to the fountain source of (ΙΙ). MC has it in the text, but marks it as
additional. LA gives it in the margin. But OA, ΟΕ, (Il—except MD,
which as so often in the addiceres follows OC-omit, It is manifest that this
passage rests upon authority quite different from that supporting either the
addicto immediately before or the oue next following, or most of the other
passages of like nature in fs. 45-151. And there is here further proof that
(Ι) has not taken its additional passages from (ΙΙ).

This does not mean that the oddicionec in (Ι) for this hundred folios may
not have come from some source outside of the group itself. It is altogether
possible that the common ancestor of the nucleus of (Ι) took into the margins
of a certain number of its folios or quires additional passages from a source
different from that from which its main text had been derived-just as OA
