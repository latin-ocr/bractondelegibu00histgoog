Rancront: DE LEGIBUS

we can not but be doubtful, with the weight of evidence against its having
come from Bracton.

F. 25, ll. 613. Et quidsi mmmm . . . . et mom prima. Regulus in OD,
MD, MH, CM, ΟΟ (marks additional), B (marks additional). Marginal in
LA, Y (later hand). Inserted at the end of sect. 1, f. 241), in ΟΕ (marks
additional), ΜΟ (marks plus). Omitted in OA, OB, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΕ, ΜΝ,
ΟΕ. An early addicio, probably, though not certainly, from Bracton.

F. 26, ll. 14-20. Dictum est. . . . aeroma erit. An interpolated reference
to a case from the time of Edward Ι. Omitted by the manuscripts.

F. 26, ll. 3233. Ad hocfecit. . . . regis per totum. Omitted in OA,
OC, OD, OF, ΟΕ, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΟ, ΟΕ, ΟΜ, LA, and manuscripts generally.
Clearly not from Bracton.

F. 261), ll. 39-42. Hoc eet quia ai. . . . amo revocator. Regular in
OD, MD, CM, LA, MC (marks plus), B (marks additional), OC (marks
additional). Marginal in ΜΕ. Omitted in OA, OB, ΟΕ, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΝ,
ΟΕ, ΟΟ, Y. Though this addicio was written to explain a statement which
hardly seems to need such an explanation, there is no reason why Bracton
may not have been the author of it.

F. 27,11. 1-6. Et (a) per assisam. . . .rea domata Regular in LA,
MC (marks plus). Marginal in OC, MA, MD. Inserted aster valebit testo-
memtmm, l. 11, f. 27, in ΜΗ, ΟΜ. Omitted in OA, OB, ΜΒ, ΜΝ, ΟΟ, ΟΕ,
ΜΕ, Υ. In its nature this addicio isvery similar to the one which almost
immediately precedes it. In each case, taking into consideration the passage
itself, its relation to the text, and the manuscript authority on which it rests,
we can hardly do less than admit the probability of Bracton having been the
writer. ’

F. 28, ll. 2-4. Item pluribus. . . . et successive. Omitted in OC, OD,
ΟΕ, CC. Used as a rubric in OA, OB, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΟ, ΜΝ, ΜΟ, ΜΗ,
ΟΕ, ΟΜ, LA, Y, MD. Obviously this should not be made a part of the
text proper.
