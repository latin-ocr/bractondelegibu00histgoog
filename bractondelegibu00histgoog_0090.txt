BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

other words, whose division into quires answers to a division into books and
chapters‚ is a MS. which stands near in order of den'vation to the original MS,
and (2) that any blank leaves at the end of equire and any sign that blank
leaves have been excised tend to prove that the MS. which is in our hand is
reproducing the shape of its immediate ancestor.”¹ Since ΟΑ mensures up to
the requirements of both these rules‚ it is therefore, on that basis a primary
copy of the original.

All this sounds plausible, the idea is very attractive. Yet every vital part
of the theory is based upon supposition; there is not a single fact upon which
it ean be made to depend. In the first place it is assuming too much to
suppose that the beginnings of prominent divisious in the Dc Legibus would
in the author's own copy usually coincide with the beginnings of new quires.
That they might, no one will deny; that they should do so of necessity is not
at all apparent. Bracton’s scheme was well laid out, as we have seen; its
broader outlines would not admit of many changes. Granted that he might
have written the latter part of his book before the beginning, it is not easy to
think of him as working otherwise than consecutively after f. 159b, at the
furthest. The words with which he starts so many new subjects, “Dictum
est supra,'’ etc, certainly lead us to infer that one subject was practically
finished before another was begun, even for that part of the text earlier in
order than f 159b.⁹ He did make a good many additions from time to time,
but these were scattered through the different folios and not lumped at the end
of the quire. As he wrote by titles rather than by books he could hardly
begin a new Liber with a new quire. In many cases the transition from one
large subject to another is so grsdual as to preclude even the suggestion of a
break. All things considered, it seems more reasonable to think of Bracton as
working st his book in a regular way and taking upa new subject aster
finishing the one preceding it. And we are so thoroughly in sympathy with
the dictum of him whose words we have quoted above-“In the middle ages
parchment was valuable, and men did not willingly waste it. Any one familiar

' with medieval books will be struck by signs of a rigid economy”⁸-that we
