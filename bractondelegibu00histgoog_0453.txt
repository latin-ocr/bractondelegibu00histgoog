THE ADDICIONES

11. 171118, 11. 43-24. Notandum quod 111111. . . . quod 11011 possit.
Omitted in OA, ΟΒ, OD, OE, MA, ΜΒ, MC, MN, CE, LA, Y. On a
separate slip in Lc. Inserted 1111111111111110111101, l. 111. 17b‚ in OF, MG,
Β (marks additional), ΜΗ (marks additional); aster de successionibus, l. 1,
1. 1711, in OC, MD (marks as quarta addicis usquehuc). Another additional
passage 01 uncertain position, which the best manuscripts in groups (l) and
(III) do not accept as 1 part of the treatise.

F. 2111, ll. 2-27. Item liberum potest . . . . teneat quam mullum. Omitted

in OA, OB, OD, ΜΒ, ΜΝ, MC, LA, ΟΕ, Υ, MA (has four lines of this in
margin). On a separate slip in LC. Marked as additional by OE. Inserted
aster ι110111 possit pertinere, 1111 line, 1. 21, in OF, MG, B (marks additional).
In all three of these manuscripts (OF, MG, Β) this applies only to the first
part 01 the addicio through imle fmimeco seruitio, after which comes etita

quod ille (f. 2111111111). . ..11111111 inelusivus (l. 212111). The rest 01
the addicis, beginning with Item poterit quas dare, follows partem, uel 11011
rescatentes. The whole passage is inserted aster quod 111111111 libere,
l. 22, 1. 22, in OC (marks additional), MD (marks 11 quinta additio esquelio).
This is the fourth 01 those addicimus which are found on slips in LC. Itis of
the same type as the three which have preceded it, and what has been said 01
them applies in a general way to it also. Any addicis which, like this, is so
generally repudiated by (I) and (ΙΙΙ) has only the very slightest claims 01
having come from Bracton.

F. 23, ll. 25-27. 11 de bac 1110111111. . . . de Ricardo le Hace. Regular
in OC, Β (marks additional). Inserted aster expresse 1110111111, 1. 31, 1. 23,
in MG, CM. Omitted in OA, OB, MA, MN, MC, MD, ME, CC, ΟΕ,
LA, Y. This is one 01 the many passages which it is equally hard either to
keep 01 throw away. The case cited is found in the Note Boolm it has been
annotated there; the point brought out in the case is identical with the explana-
tion made by Bracton; the citation is in Bracton’s regular form. Yet from
the evidence 01 the manuscripts themselves we are hardly justified in making
it a part 01 the treatise. At the best it is 01 extremely doubtful origin.

F. 231), ll. 27-15. Quia sicut tenementum succedere . . . . decem, 1111111 loco
succedit. Regular in ME, OE (marks additional). On a separate slip in LC.
Inserted aster suo fioffuto, l. 24, 1. 231), in OF, MG, CM, Β (marks
additional); aster 1111111111 remoti, l. 6,f. 211100 (marks additional), MD
(marks as addicto 1111111 usque bic). Omitted in OA, OB, OD, OG, MA,
ΜΒ, MC, MN, CE, LA, Y. Another long addicis about whose authorship
