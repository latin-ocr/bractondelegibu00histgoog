THE ADDICIONES

In one place or another not a little has already been said about the
additional passages, or additiones, which make up a noticeably large portion of
the printed textos Braeton. Something more must yet be said, for the subject
is very important. The determination of just what passages are addr'eiom,
and more particularly additional passages not written by Bracton himself, is
one of the hardest problems connected with the re-editing of the treatise.¹

There is too much matter in the traditional text of Bracton. A very
casual examination of the manuscript material shows that. In the preface to
the first edition, the unknown editor who signs himself “T. N.’' makes a
number of statements which indicate that, to a certain extent at least, he was
cognizant of the corrupt texts of the manuscripts, of a variety of readings in
the different exemplare which he had looked over, and of interpolations in some
of them.⁹ From his words we might reasonably expect to find that he had
remedied some of the worst features of the manuscript texts about which he
was complaining. But though he claims to have used twelve manuscripts
only about forty variants are noted for the whole four hundred and forty-four
folios of text. He seems to have made no effort at all to get rid of interpola·
tions, and posses over without comment even those addiciones which some
among his twelve manuscripts must have marked out for him. It is not
necessary to consider how many of the extant manuscripts he may have made
use of. That he either selected different codices as the basis of his text in
different parts of the treatise, or happened to use a single manuscript derived
from an exemplar, or exemplare, embodying different traditions, is made clear
by a study of the collated passages, It is quite evident that any comparison
