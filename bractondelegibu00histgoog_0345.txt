PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

The oddicio on fia is found in the text of less than half of the total
number of manuscripts. It concerns groups (ΙΙ) and (ΙΙΙ), though not all the
members in each of these groups contain it. Both OE and MD have clearly
taken it from (ΙΙ), agreeing with this group in their readings. It is evident,
too, that OE's marginalia came from a text in the line of OF, MH, CB, etc.,
while MD goes rather with OC and LD. The question as to whether (ΙΙ)
derived this additional passage from (ΙΙΙ), or vice versa, is one which may be
left unanswered until the subjectos the addam is discussed, aS, with the
exceptions just noted, the manuscripts are found in the same groups for the
addicfo as for the text proper.

Forty manuscripts contain this passage. It is evident at once that the
nucleus of (Ι) a (oa, na, ΜΒ, Mn, Ml, Mu, ca, ΗΒ, aa, nra ocur),
(OF, MG, CC, LB, X, and probably B); and of (ΙΙΙ), (OA, OD, LA, PH,
ML, CE). For (Ι) there are the sub-groups (OB, LG), (LF in this passage
does not show the usual close connection with OB, LG), (MA, ΜΙ)), (ΜΙ,
LC); for (ΙΙ), (OF, MG, CC, ΕΒ), (ΟΕ, MG), (CC, LB); and for (ΙΙΙ),
(OD, PH). In addition there occurs the combination (ME, ΜΗ, CM, P,
-Β). Is this a fourth group or a sub-group in one of the larger combinationsl
Then there is the question as to the relative positions of the clearly distinguished
suhgroups (OG, Y), (ΜΕ, ΜΗ, CM), (CF, ΕΤ), (ΟΜ, HA), (OE, W).
Standing out more or less individually are OC, ΜΒ, ΜΚ, LD, LE, X, Y.

Among the variants in which (Ι) is found in combination with other
manuscripts are: terremoto (teocoaeoto aon), (Ι) -MD, LF, ÷MF, OG, Y,

these facts together we are forced to put OG, Y, ME, MH, CM, P, in (ΙΙ),
which group is more in agreement with (Ι) than with (ΙΙΙ), although on
