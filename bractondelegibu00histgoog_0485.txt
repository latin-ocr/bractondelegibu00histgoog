THE ADDICIONES

F . 282, ll. 8-82. Sine praeiudicia.. . . saonam habuerit. Regular in
OB, OD, MA, ΜΒ, MD, ME, MN, ΜΙ, Y. Inserted after cap. ΙΙ, Ι. 288,
ln OC, ΟΕ, MC; aster the following addicto, in OF. Marginal in OA.
Omitted in LA, CB (which inserts a folio that contains the omitted part).
This is clearly from Bracton.

Fs. 2822821), ll. 82-25. Cam frater . . . . receati saisina. Regular in
OB, OD, MA, ΜΒ, MD, ME, MN, Y. Inserted at the end of cap. II,
f. 288 (following the addicto immediately before this), in MC, CE3 after cap.
IV, f. 284, in OC, OF, OG, ΜΙ (followed by the addicto which should regu·
larly precede, both additiones occurring again in Ml in regular order).
Marginal in OA. Omitted in LA. Another addition by Bracton.

F. 2881), ll. 10-12. Quia aaa ia. . . . ias aarum. Regular in OD.
Inserted after cap. II, f. 288 (following the addt’cio on f. 282), in OG, aster
proprietate, l. 8, in OC. Marginal in OA. Omitted in OB, OF, MA, ΜΒ,
MC, ΜΙ, CE, CM, LA, Y. In content and form of expression this is much
the same as the addit-io on f. 267, but unless the collation to be made later
results in the discovery of this passage in out of the way places in some of the
texts which are here given as omitting it, we can not accept it as one of
Bracton’s own additions.

F. 2851), ll. 6-11. Intercatiam quos... ansas. Regular in PH.
Inserted after tenente (petente), l. 4, in MC (which has as a rubric for it,
Littera ista aaa reperitur ia alio libro). Marginal in OA, LA. Omitted in
OB, OC, OD, OF, OG, OM, MA, ΜΒ, MF, MG, MH, ΜΙ, CE, LT, B,
P, Y. This contains a reference to a case having to do with the Church of
St. Mary‚ Oxford. The addicto itself is clearly one belonging to (ΙΙΙ) alone
and as such can not be given a place in the treatise.

Fs. 287b-288‚ ll. 85-1. Si autem bastardus. . . . fecerit, etc. Regular in
OD, ME. Inserted after masam, l. 86, f. 287, in 0G; after calocerum, l. 27,
8288, in OF, MI. Marginal in OA, OC. Omitted in OB, MA, ΜΒ, MC,
MD, ΟΕ, LA, Y. A passage of doubtful authorship. .

F. 290, ll. 12-10. sed admitti . . . . optas esset. Regular in OD.
Inserted altercatio, l. 10, in OC, OF, OG, MD, MI. Marginnl in OA.
Omitted in OB, MA, ΜΒ, MC, ME, CB, LA, Y. In this, as in the
preceding addicto, the chances are that OD is giving an additio from the
tradition of (Ill-see p. 881, above-while MC, LA and the main text
of OA are keeping the original tradition of (ΙΙΙ). This would mean

that both (Ι) and (ΙΙΙ) do not vouch for the passages, which on this
