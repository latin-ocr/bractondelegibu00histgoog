THE ADDICIONES

Eyre Roll which is not from either Raleigh or Pateshull, though in this
manner he refers to these two judges some one hundred and thirty times.¹
Moreover, this was not the kind of a mistake about which a later annotator
would be apt to concern himself ; if some one besides the author made this
correction it is unique. On the other hand, any one competent to make this
emendation would in all likelihood know that Bracton was with Turkilby in
29 Henry III-it is even conceivable that the knowledge of this fact might
have been the reason for the change in the citation having been made. The
omission of the passage by group (ΙΙ) can not be made to support any
contentiori in this discussion because the very same manuscripts make 'exactly
the same kind of an omission some few lines later in the reference to the case
of Hemy de Scaccario from 12 Henry III, which citation the other manu-
scripts, with the exception of OC, give regularly without the least indication
that there is anything doubtful about it. What we can be certain about as
regards this passage on f. 413 is that a mistake was made in a citation given
by Bracton himself and later corrected; but whether the ,mistake was made
by the author or by a copyist, whether the correcting was done by Bracton or
some one aster him, is uncertain.

Uncertainty in one form or another, or on one point or another, is a
prevailing characteristic of the addiciooes in general. All too often it is
sufficient to prevent any positive assertion as to the authorship of a passage
from being made. For this reason it is necessary to approach any question
dealing with the actual origin of an addicio with considerable diffidence. It
makes it necessary, also, to maintain a very conservative attitude in the
matter of accepting or rejecting any particular addicto. So instead of elimi-
nating much of the additional matter, all for which no thoronghly satisfactory
authority can be found, it seems better and safer to eliminate only what is
clearly not from Bracton, and to retain much as doubtful, marking it as such.
By making use of this method of selection there will be no danger of repudiat-
ing anything which really belongs in the treatise. Moreover, there will in
this way be preserved many thirteenth century addiciones which are instructive
even if they do not come from Bracton. If mistakes are made in assigning
to Bracton addieioaes which do not belong to him, these mistakes will in all
probability be rectified by the complete collation of many texts which is to
follovv. The discussion which accompanies each addicto in the list below
enables us to balance uncertainties with a number of certainties‚ and fumishes
