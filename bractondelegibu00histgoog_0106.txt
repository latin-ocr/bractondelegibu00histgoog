BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

m.,’' etc.¹ In the records of an inquisition taken at Exeter in 20 Edward I is
the entry, “Dunterton. The manor with the advowson of a church, held by
Andrew de Trollosk by service of a knight’s fee.''² In 25 Edward Ι, before
the king's judges at Westminster‚ testimony was taken in regard to the age of
Eleanor‚ daughter of William de Mohoun. John de Asshele of Walshebum,
knight, “aged 60 years and more, distant three leagues from Stokefleming,”
testified that she was born at Stokefleming in 9 Edward Ι. Eleanor de
Fisshaker was her godmother. Further, “Andrew de Truslok‚ then of
Brickenham, knight, aged 60 years and more, distant three leagues from Stoke-
fleming, agrees with the above Roger.''⁸ Itis not necessary to go any further
in this direction. Here is evidence enough to show beyond any doubt that
one of the earlier owners of HA, probably the first one, apparently a lawyer,
made use of points in cases which had to do with the people among whom he
was, or had been, living in a certain part of Devonshire‚ to emphasize or
contradict statements in the text of his De Legibus. He did exactly the
same thing as the man, or men, whoever he or they may have been, that wrote
Corbio, and Waae Montocute, and Tatcslrolh in the earlier copies. And for
the same purpose. Every clement to be found in the first set of annotations
is to be found also in the second, except that the latter have to do with cases
which date from a period after Bracton’s death, and with which, therefore, he
could have had no personal connection. But there is here the same personal
touch which we find in the first set of annotatiom. Whether or not the
annotator was a permanent resident of this part of Devonshire‚ he certainly
knew the places and the people well. Only one thoroughly acquainted with
the details of a case could get anything out of such notes as these; “pro
Morleghe'’ and “contra Andr.” would mean nothing to a stranger. More-

over, both sets of annotations have to do with the same region, with those
parts of southwestem England in which Bracton for so many years before his
