BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

Foaros ab auu ob

Here are two short passages for which forty manuscripts have been collated.
They are near enough to each other to be considered as one, and in them
it might be expected that the groups would bc about the same as those for
fs 88h35. Using group (Ι) of this latter place as a guide to what will
probably be found in (Ι) for the earlier folios now under discussion, the follow-

ing sub-groups may be brought together-(OB, OE, ΜΒ, MN, LC, LF,
LG), (OB, LF, LG), (MA, MD), (MN, ΜΒ), (CF, ΒΤ). LC shows a
tendency to agree with ΜΒ and MN. OE, in which the portion of text
including fs aab-35 was missing, agrees with both the smaller OB group and
the line of ΜΒ, ΜΝ. By following the leading of thc variants autem, pro,
multo fortias in superiorem, and recuperandum it is possible to form the larger
group (OB, OE, MA, ΜΒ, MD, MF, MN, ΟΕ, LF, LG, Y, CF, ΒΤ).
CF and LT are often in agreement with lines other than that of (Ι). ΟΑ is
found at least three times in decisive agreement with (Ι) as a group. The
connection of ΟΕ with (Ι) is very marked in the variants which determine the
large group, but it does not come into the sub-groups. For fs. cahat both
ΟΑ and CE were put in (ΙΙΙ), on the OB side of the middle line, though the
inclination of ΟΕ towards (Ι) was not so marked thereos in these earlier folios
ME, CC, P, again form a sub-group, but not under (Ι). The position of Y
and ΜΒ is apparently the same as for fs. aab-35. The main points of
relationship may be shown thus:
