BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

(and the consequent marginalia in two others) ducto the fact that two all but
adjacent sentences began with the same three words? The latter is more
probable, all things considered, but there is no definite proof either way.

F. 428, ll. 17-18, vel ratione nonime . . . . ratione peremturum. This
is similar in a way to the last example. Omitted in OA, MA, MD, CC, CE.
Regular in OB, ΜΒ, ΜΝ, MC, ME, CM. Atthis place in the text MA and
MD form a pair group; OA, CC, CE, are related. The passage being regular
in OB, ΜΒ, ΜΝ, shows that it was regular in the common ancestor of group
(Ι), to which MA and MD belong. We can know definitely, therefore, that

this piece of marginalia is the result of an omission made in the two
manuscripts which were the ancestors of MA, MD, and OA, CC, CE,

F. raab, ll. 26·28, Item oon urfficit. . . . illam dosordoverit. Here is
a passage omitted by OA, OC, OD, MA, ΜΒ, MC, ME, MN, CE, CM, MD,
the only manuscripts which have been examined for it. Coupling this with the
fact that the sentence as it occurs in Vis but a repetition of the sentence which
precedes it, we need have no hesitation in classifying this as an addition which
has crept into the text of some manuscript used by the editor of V, though
like the typical omitted passages it begins and ends with words similar to
those beginning or ending near-by sentences. ¹

Scores of cases of just such omissions which have the appearance of
additiones are to be found in the manuscripts. The comparison of the different
codices has eliminated most of them. A few have been kept among the
additiones in the list below because like the passage on f. 180 just referred to
they do not admit of a definite solution as to their exact nature.

lt should be kept in mind that there is no manuscript so infallible in its
marginalia that every one of its marginal passages must be regarded as an
addicio. Even OA does not come up to that standard, and OA is by far the
best manuscript in the matter of indicating addicioner by putting them in the
margin. Most of the marginal passages in this manuscript prove to be
addiciooca when the other manuscripts are compared, but some of them seem
hardly to come under this head. There are three classes of typical marginalia
in which OA is not backed up by the other manuscripts. First, where OA
has in the margin a passage which the other manuscripts omit. An example
of this is found on f. 194b‚1.3. Ut inter lhomom veter-ia pontia et Ricardmn
is omitted in OB, OC, OD, OF, MA, ΜΒ, MC, ME, CE, LA, ten manu-
scripts representing at least seven lines of descent. ln the margin of OA is,
Thoan de Veteri Ponte et Ricardrar dc Laoggsord. Again, on the page which
