THE ADDICIONES

ΟΕ and Y, and not with (ΙΙ) or OA, LA. This is the same general relation·
ship which is shown by the main text. It looks as though for fs. 45-151 at
least, (1), ΟΕ and Y had all derived the uddiciorrea from the same source. Such
a source could not very well be far from the original itself. Doubtless some of
the additions to the text which did not come from Bracton appeared very early
in the life of the manuscripts' texts. Not fora moment can it be maintained
that the age of an addicio is any sure proof of its authorship. And therefore the
fact that these adda'cioaea in (Ι) are very old does not stamp them at once as from
Bracton. Like all the other additional matter they must each be subjected to
individual examinatiou before their caseis decided. But their authenticity is so
generally vouched for by the manuscripts at large that their presence in (Ι) does
notat all make it necessary to alter the opinion expressed above, that the accept·
ance of an addaio by the representative members of (Ι), (ΙΙ) and (ΙΙΙ) is avery
strong indication of its having come from Bracton's pen.

For fs 152-183-198 there is no longer noticeable the decisive agreement
between (Ι), ΟΕ, and Y, which is so clear for fs. 45-151. Not only does (Ι)
more and more often omit, but both ΟΕ and Y frequently omit where (1)
gives the addicio in the text. An omission by ΟΕ should not count against
an adaiae. Nor should the fact that it is omitted or marginal in OA or LA.
That an additional passage from Bracton may meet with just such a recep
tion from these three manuscripts is proven by the prosequatur. . . . de
iare passage on f. 161b, where out of forty manuscripts OA, LA, ΟΕ, and ML
alone omit from the main text. These same four manuscripts are the only
ones to omit the last niueteen lines of cap. ΙΙΙ, f. laih-162, Item satit qua
. . . . per tole breve, which may or may not be an addicto, but is most certainly

from Bracton. In the case of both these passages (Ι) is clearly more correct '

than ΟΕ and ML and the text as originally written in OA and LA.
Continuiug this comparison for the next few addicioraea we find: f. 163, ΙΙ. 7-9,
in the main text of (Ι), OD, ΜΟ, Ρ, Χ, W, OM, MF, LC, LD, omitted in
ΟΕ, Y, ML, OC and (ΙΙ) generally, marginal in OA, LA, ΟΒ; f. 163, l. 14,
in the main text of (Ι), OD, MC, ΟΕ, Y, P, X, W, OM, MF, LC, LD,
omitted in ΟΟ and (ΙΙ) generally, marginal in OA and LA; f. 163, l. 40, in

the main text of (Ι), ΟΕ, Y, OD, ΜΟ, OC aud (ΙΙ) generally, X, W, OM,
LC, LD, omitted in ML, MF, P, marginal in OA and LA; fs. 165-165b,
ll. 4643111 the main text of OD, MC, OC and (ΙΙ) generally, MF, LD,
omitted in (Ι), ΟΕ, Y, P, ML, W, OM, marginal in OA and LA; f. 166,
the rubric for section one, in the main text of OA, ΟΕ, ΜΟ, OD, (Ι), (ΙΙ),
