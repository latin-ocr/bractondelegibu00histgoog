BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

mark the beginning of their second and third books by large omamented letters
in the text, but in both these manuscripta, hands different from the text have,
by directions in the margin, begun these books elsewhere. It is not necessary
to multiply examples. It is important to emphasize the fact that most of
these divisions of the text by books stand apert from the text itself. There is
always the suspicion that divisions made in this external sort of way have been
taken from a source other than that from which the text has been derived.
With so many of the manuscripts copied from more than one exemplar we can
not be at all sure as to the origin of the external features of a codex. When
the evidence is thoroughly analyzed the manuscripts really give us but little
authority to begin a book at any special place. Consider the case of the second
book which has just been taken up. Referring to the data above it will be
seen that the authority for beginning book two at t107 rests on eleven
manuscripts. This is about one-fourth of the total number examined3 actually
in point of numbers it stands for considerably more than one-fourth, for many
of the copies have no scheme of book division. On first sight it would appear
that the authority for adopting the plan of these manuscripts was quite
adequate. But of the eleven codiceS, OB, OE, Ml, Le, LF, LG, are so
closely related as to count as one. Of the other five, MD has been marked by
a different hand at the wrong place, its text and kalendar both showing that it
began the second book on f. 118. MC, ΟΕ, Ρ, are not divided in the text,
but by different hands in kalendar or text margin. This leaves ΟΛ to be
considered. Here is a codex about which more has been written than about
all the other Bracton manuscripts combined; it is one of the best which has
been preserved, the very best as far as the oddieioaes are concemed; from it we
might expect to get some definite information about this second book. We
are not disappointed. The information it gives is very definite as far as itis
itself concemed. It tells us most plainly that in the manuscript from which
this portion of OA was copied, the second book did not begin at the place now
marked. Turn to f. 55b of OA and 107 of the printed text. At the top of

the page OA has in large colored capitals, Liber Secundus. The next most
noticeable thing on the page is a large omamented C, drawn iri the margin, as
close to the line of the text as possible, opposite the beginning of chapter nine
in V. Now look at the text in the manuscript. The last words of V’s eighth
chapter have ended a line, neatly and evenly. The next line begins even with
the line above, Cum uatem, etc. Cura has a capital C, but it is the small,
plain capital which begins a sentence or a section, not the large capital which
