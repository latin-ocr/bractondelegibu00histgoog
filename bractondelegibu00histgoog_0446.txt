therefore be authentic even if it is not in the Note Book. A vital question
is as to whether or not every case which occurs in the Note Book and also in
the treatise must have been inserted in the latter by the author. It is a note-
worthy fact that the manuscripts give very doubtful support to some of the
addicimus which are references to cases found in the Note Book. Itis not
always easy to explain this if we assume that Bracton wrote these additions.
From such evidence as can be gotten together it seems so altogether probable
as to be almost certain that the Note Book was made for Bracton and that he
used it. But this does not preelude the possibility of some one else having
made use of it alter Bracton’s death. Fitzherbert seems to have used it at a
much later time.¹ It is quite within the limits of plausibility and reason that
some one nearer to 1268 studied the book in connection with the treatise, much
as Bracton did, and jotted down resulting marginalia in much the same way.
More than one man annotated the Note Boolc.⁹ Some of the most important
annotations may not have come from Bracton at all. A later owner may

ι have made far greater use of it than he. Whatever the facts on this point

they can never be known. But there is nothing in what we do know that
compels us to believe that everything in any way pertaining to the Note Book
or associated with it is in some way also connected with Bracton. The case
reference which is an addicto must be treated just the same as any other
addida, even though the case itself is found in the Note Boolc.

As all these case reference additiones will be discussed in their proper
places along with the other additional passages there is no need of considering
them in order here. Some important points may, however, be brought out
by comparing a few of them.

In the first place, the fact that the citation ofa case agrees in form with
Bracton’s way of citing a case can not be depended on to prove anything
about its authorship. The first three case addideras, fs. 18, 23, 29, show this.
The first two of these are in Bracton’s regular style, and the second is found
also in the Note Book, yet the manuscript authority on which they rest is so
slight that at best they are of very doubtful origin. The third is in what
must be regarded as an unusual form in spite of the fact that the same sort of
comment occurs again on fs. 45, 49b. But because of the way in which it is
supported by the manuscripts, this addicto has far better claims than either of
the other two to be considered a part of the treatise. In many another
