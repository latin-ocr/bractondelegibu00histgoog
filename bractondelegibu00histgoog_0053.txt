PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

tractatu de placito super iure et proprietate, de seisina propria vel alicuius ante·
cessoris, et de essoniis et aliis dilationibus in dicto placito accidentibus, et de car-
tis producendis et warantis vocandis et de diversis exceptionibus. Nunc autem
in quinto tractatu dicendum est de iurisdictionibus et de hiis quae pertinent ad
fomm seculare et ad forum ecclesiasticum, et de diversis prohibitionibus, et de
brevi quod dicitur Indicavit, de minoribus infra aetatem existentibus, et de
diversis warantiis de exceptione bastardiae, et aliis diversis exceptionibus
de solempnitate attachiamentorum in quibuscumque actionibus. In fine autem
quarti libri agitur de exceptione quae proponitur contra iurisdictionem. Et ideo
nunc primo videndum est quid sit iurisdictio, et quae sint eius divisiones ”¹
From the fore'going, two things are evident. First, that the new books
in V have been begun at points where the text itself notes a change
from one subject to another; and second, that although OB, OE, etc,
start their new books with new subjects the change to the new subject is not,
with one exception, so plainly marked in the text. Moreover, the rubrics of
OB and OE look as though they had been made up from the perusal of some
table of contents rather thau from a study of the text. Those of OB deliber·
ately referto the table of contents with, “et aliis ut supra in kalendariis”
Subjects are not always arranged according to order, as in the rubric to book

three. A smaller subject is sometimes given equal prominence with a larger
subject, as in OE’s rubrio to the second book. The supposition which will
best explain them is that at first some kalendar was divided into books by
simple marks of Ι, ΙΙ, or liber secandas, liber tertius, etc, in the margin, and
that later some copyist or rubricator made the briefest kind of synopsis of the
matter included between these marks in the form of a rubric to stand at the

beginning of the books so divided. From their form it is certain that they
were not written by the author of the text, or by any one who understood
thoroughly the subject-matter of the treatise. They have inherent in them-
selves no more authority for their arrangement of books than the rubrics in
L'r have for the arrangement found in V.² In both cases we shall have to get

¹M1surts this rubrio with, “Quarto libro finito. Incipit liber quintus,” etc. OBhas, “Incipit liber
quintus. Decimo libro pertinens de iurisdictionibus,'' etc. LG reads, “Incipit liber secuudusfflr) decimo
libro pertinens de iurisdictionibua,” etc. The dsobrw has of course come from the Roman numeral V with a ,

small o or to over it having been changed to X merely by the prolongation oi one or both oi the dowuward ’

strokes. The reversal oi this by the shorteniug nithe strokes has caused an original XX iu Bracton's text
(i. 96) tobecome XV. .

¹ lu the kalendar st book ΙΙΙ, LT has in red ink, “capitula libri tertii. lit dividitur iste liber iu duos

tractatus quorum primus tractatus est de actionibus civilibus. Et incipit ibi, Dictum est snpra de personis et
rebus. Secundus tractatus est de actionibus criminalibus, id est de corona. Et incipit ibi, Acta coram
iusticiariis Itinerantibus.”
