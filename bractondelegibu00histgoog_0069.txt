PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

that he is prejudiced against a system to which the reader is more accustomed.
As though to emphasize the fact that this difference is only in the form of
arrangement and not in his treatment of the material, he begins his next
sentence with the words, “ln hoc autem tractatu sicut in aliis tractatibus
consideranda sunt haec.’' Now the most satisfactory interpretation of this
added explanation of Bracton is that in his association of ideas the word Summo
brought up most vividly the thought of Azo's book, or bookS, from which he
was to copy, and to which he was to refer for help and suggestion for a long
time to come. Azo had reached a place of highest prominence as a legist, he
was “master of all the masters of the laws. ”¹ lt might be expected that any
one who, in writing a book of law, was closely following his text would follow
also his method of arrangement. For it was impossible to improve upon Azo.
But for reasons of his own Bracton did not see fit to follow the scheme of the
Bolognese master; he preferred to use an arrangement different from that found
not only in Azo‚ but in the Codc, Digest and Institutas, as well as in his
English model Glonoill. And in making this choice he felt it necessary to
half apologize for departing from the method used by so many eminent writers
before him, just as earlier he had apologized for calling the unwritten laws of
England leges.

Why Bracton decided to write hy titles and paragraphs rather than by
books is not an easy question to answer. It it clear that he felt a difference
between his work and that of his Roman predecessors From the very first
he emphasized the fact that his treatise was to be one on English law. As this
law had not been reduced to a written, definite arrangement, he may have felt
that it was more or less chaotic‚ too unorganized for treatment under the
orderly Roman scheme. Nor could he well follow Glanvill. Its material at
times he would be able to use to advantage; but as a work the earlier De
Legibus must have seemed to Bracton brief, fragmentary, ill-arranged, lacking
the scope and finish which he intended to give to his own productiori. While
he was working over the Roman elementa, with Azo to guide him, it would be an
easy matter to conform to the traditional division of books; but the situation
would be quite otherwise when he got to that great mass of unwritten English
law, with no model to help him, especially as this latter subject was to form
by far the larger part of his treatise. In regard to this English law he knew
the topics about which he wished to write—he had probably already drawn up
a topical outline. But he could not at the beginning tell just what amount of
