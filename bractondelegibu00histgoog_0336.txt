BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS

The addida, without doubt one of Bracton's own additions is found in all
the texts with the exception of-CE and ML, whose scribes probably omitted
to copy a passage which was marginal iu their exemplars. As far as position

is concenred, we find that OD, MC, Y, P, MF, of (ΙΙΙ) agree with (11); (Ι)
as a group ohooses a position distinct from otbers; OC goes in with the CA,
CF, LD, etc, group. It shows a tendency also to follow this group in its
readings. Y has been corrected by a manuscript closely alrin to CA. Other·
wise the relationsbip remains the same as in the text proper.

For this chapter thirty-seven manuscripts have been collated. Three
groups stand out distinctly: (Ι) ΟΒ, OD, MA, MD, ΜΒ, MF, MI, MN, LF,
LG, Y, HA; (II) OA, OF, MG, MK, CB, CC, ΗΒ, Β, Χ; and (IV) OM,
ΜΕ, ΜΗ, ΜΜ, LC, LT, CM, P, W. Outside of these three groups are OC,
OG, CE, MC, LA, ML, LD, each of which will require separate discussion,
but which together we may designate for convenience as (III).

In (Ι) occur the subgroups (OB, OD, MF, LF, LG), (OB, LF, LG),
(OD, ΜΡ), (MA, MD). MA, MD, ΜΙ, are nearer to the line of OB than
are ΜΒ, ΜΝ, and Y, these latter three being more distant in the order named.
