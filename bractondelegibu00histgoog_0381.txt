PEDIGREE OF THE· MANUSCRIPTS

if a number of examples are chosen from some of the passages already
collated. Whatever may be the full significance of these variants which are
to be discussed, they are important because they are so old as to go back
further than any extant manuscript in the nucleus of group (Ι). This does
not apply to all the variants common to (1) as a group, for there are
traditional variants in that group which are on exactly the same basis as the
traditional variants in other groups. It should also be kept in mind that not
all the manuscripts which from time to time find themselves in ll) are
conoemed‚ but only those which consistently ¹form the nucleus of the larger
combination. This little group is well defined, but limited in numbers= lt
was not to be expected that their peculiarities wotdd indefinitely continue
among their descendants, for the very common practice of comparing one
manuscript with another seems to have quite rapidly restored omitted passages
of any proportionS, and to have altered most of the decidedly different readings
in any one line. Notice, for instance, how MD, which is in a pair group with
MA, has been altered by corrections in the common exemplar of these two
manuscripts in regard to the first variant considered below.

At the beginning off. 84 Bracton is speaking of circumstances connected
with the making of a donation which would render it necessary for a tenant to
show his charter to prove an exception. There follow these words: “Si
autem cartam forte exhibere non possit, quia illam ad manum non habuerit,
dc necessitate erit ad patriam recurrendum. (Et eodem modo si casum
allegaverit et casum probaverit.) Et sciendum quod privatorum instru-
mentorum tres sunt species, . . . . ” The rest of the sectionis taken up with
a discussion of instrumenta and contracta. It will be noticed that the sentence
here enclosed in parentheses is not in any way necessary to the continuity of the
rest of the passage. On the other hand it has every appearance of being an
asterthought. It is just the kind of sentence which would be added on a
rereading, short, concise, and adding a fact which is connected with, and yet

apart from, the sequence of ideas in the rest of the paragraph. Everything

about it suggests that it is something thrown in later. lt is omitted in OB, ‘

MA, ΜΒ, ΜΝ, La, LG. Near the middle of the same folio, at the
beginning of section three, we have, “De cartis vero regiis et factis regum,

non debent nec possunt iusticiarii nec privatae personae disputare, . . . .'’ 'rhe
regum is omitted in OB, MA, ΜΒ, ΜΝ, LF, LG. Is not the addition of

this word another alterthought on Bracton’s part? The passage would be
complete without it; its presence does not alter the sense. On a rereading
