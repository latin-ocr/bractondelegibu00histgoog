the same hand and inlr as the text, and underlined to mark them as rubrics.
Doubtless the omission of this underlining in some of the copies which were
later used as exemplars is largely responsible for so many of the rubrius having
been made a part of different texts. An irregular arrangement of the rubrics
-such as in MA, where some are written into the text and underlined, and
some are in the places regularly left for rubrics-would also offer opportunities
for misunderstandings and mistalres on the part of the next copyist. It is
therefore not 10 be wondered 01 that now and then a rubric should have
become part of the text proper.

As substantiating the statements made in the preceding paragraph the
following typical instances of the use of rubrius may be brought forward.
These are only a few ol many. The last lines of cap. XI, fs. 1261261),οἰ
corum iudiciariis. . . . siue aliu secto, are omitted in many of the manuscripts.
MA uses them as a rubric for the following chapter. In MC they serve ns
the rubric for a new bloclr of text beginning at facto prim 0 iusticiuriir, 1. 60,
1. 126. ΟΑ and LA have this sentence ns a rubric, in the margin, without
any definite directions or marks as 10 where 11 should go, opposite the place 01
which it is found in MC. It is marked as additional and inserted atterere
purte regusl. 29,f.126‚in MD and B. A folio further on, the rubric to
section ten in V is inserted by some manuscripts just before ito quid 001010,
1. 6, 1. 128; by others it is put just before atii qurum dicunt, l. 5, f. 128. In
0001) 01 these cases it is treated as 0 rubric, but B marks it additional and
inserts at the end of sect. 9, f. rarb. In the passage collated on f. 1821),
11. 88-39, Item iuste utlagatus. . . . quusi uredo genitus, are given regularly in
four manuscripts, are omitted in twenty, and are used as a rubrio—not always
in the same place-by nine others. Lines 1-5 on f. 346, 01010010 lubere . . . .
propter necessitatem (notice that these words also form the rubric for section
four, which begins only two lines further on), are by some of the manuscripts
omitted entirely, by at least one other are made part of the text and inserted
at the end of sect. Β, 1. 616, and by yet others are used as a rubric for a block
of text which begins in different manuscripts 01 two different places, neither of
which is coincident with the beginning or ending of 0 section in V.

Such facts as these have to be known and taken into consideration if the
differences in the manuscripts in regard to the rubrics are to bc rightly
interpreted. Ultimately the correct rubn'cs will have to be determined in the
same manner as the corrected text, by the collation of the best manuscripts.
But in the meantime questions arise which it is expedient to answer if that is
