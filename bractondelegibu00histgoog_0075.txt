PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

his text.¹ The first chapter on that folio begins, “Facta coram iusticiariis
itinerantibus generali suinmonitione’ ad certos diem et locum, quae ad minus
continere debet spatium quindecim dierum, videndum erit in primis qualiter
procedere debeat et quo ordine. Et sciendum quod in primis incipere debent
de placitis coronae, in quibus terminantur actiones criminales'’ Just one folio
further on the pleas of the crown again stand out prominently‚ “Inprimis de
veteribus placitis coronae quae alias fuerunt coram iusticisriis et non fuerunt
terminata De novis placitis coronas quae postea emerserunt‚’' etc.⁸ We see
“how things proceed and in what order’' as the justices start out on their
work. We hear the reading of the writ which gives them authority to make
an 111,* and one of the older of them explaining the cause of their coming and
the utility of an iter. We follow thern as they retire to some secluded spot
and call to themselves some four or six of the more important men of the
county‚ with whom they consult regardiug the business iu hand. We see
the twelve knights coming forward and taking an oath to answer truly the
questions which the justices shall ask them; we hear read to them the long list
of articles concerning which they must have averdict ready by a certain day.
And then we are ready to consider the different crimes more in detail,
and notice the method of procedure when the case comes into court.⁵ But from

f. 1151 up to the point where the civil actions begin it is always de placitas
coronoe “in which are decided criminal actions, lesser as well as greater, unless

111

perchance the lord the king himself shall order it otherwise.
F ollowiug criminal actions come civil actions real. This subject, divided
and subdivided, extending from f.1sab to 113, constitutes the great bulk— ,

² See f. 150b-“lnter 1111 placita coronae non 111 omittendum de actione furti.'’ The subject 01 11111 11
Ι oue of Bracton’s titles. He refers 10 11 ou f. 62-“ut infra dicetur de furtis.'’

¹ A vrit of general summons 11 10 be found 11 sect. 1, 1. loth. This long chapter devoted to English
write bearing ou the itinerant justices, together with the reference to the writ of general summons at tha very
beginning of De Oororro, does more thau probably anything else to obscure the fact that the subject of criminal
10110111 really begins on 1. neb. But Bracton is constantly treating one part 01 1 subject in oue place and
another part in another place, and often refers in the later 10 the earlier treatment. with this reference on
f. lleb to the writ 01 summous on 1. 1091) compare his reference on f. lssb to the discussion of the precedence
in action 01 possession over property on 1. 113. The real setting of cap. Xl (fs. 1081)-111) can not be understood
without comparing it with esp. Vll (11. 105-106); in fact, the whole 01 Do dationibus must be read before 110
full significauce 01 any one of its parts can be appreciated.

'Soet 3, 1. 116. These seme expressions occur in tha writ on fs. urb-118.
⁴ ’11111 form of writ will be found at sect. 1, 1. los.

⁸ with cap. 111, f. 118, compare eap. V, 1. 1011. 11101 makes use of 1111 same material, usas therama
expressions, and 110111 the influenoe of Glanvili.

⁰ F. 1151). The 111111 actions referred to here are taken up at cap. XXXVI, f. los-“Dictum eet supra
de maioribus criminibus, et appellis quae criminaliter intentantur. ,. . . . Nunc autem dicendum ast de minoribus
et levioribus criminibusque civiliter intentantur, sicut de actionibus iniuriarum personalibus, 11 pertinent ad
coronam.” This is but another proci that 1. 11611 11 in 111 seme treatise-Ds 001010-11 1. 165.
