Consider first the division of the treatise into parts. The printed edition
is divided into five books, of which the first is a very short one of eight folios,
and the third, fourth, and fifth, composite books, being made up of, respec-
tively‚ two, seven, and five separate treatises. This ia, for the most part, a
reasonable and natural division, and one backed up by the authority of several
manuscripts. But it is not the only one which might rest on such authority, nor
is it the one followed by either the majority or the best of those copies which
have come down to us. That Bracton for his own convenience must have
worked with some broaduoutline of his work in mind probably no one will
deny. His very method-clearly he was forced to write by subjecte-presup
poses as inevitable such a plan. This scheme, at least in a general way, we
might expect to find in all the copies of the original treatise3 even in the
differenees we might look for a certain broad similarity. When one codex
makes a division into four books, and another into five books, all but one of
the points of division might be expected to agree. But such is far from being
the rule. So great a dissimilarity is there in this respect, that it is not at all
unusual for two manuscripts to agree as to the number of books and be wholly
at variance as to the portions of text which the respective books should
contain. Osten the only division is one of chapters or sections, in which again
there is no agreement as to content. It would naturally be supposed that the
greatest differences in this matter would be found in manuscripts most widely

apart in the lines of descent, while similarity would point to close relationship. '

Inevitably this must be true in some cases But the exceptions are so
numerous that it can not be accepted as a general rule. 'lake for instance the
case of OB, LG, LF. As the collation shows, all three agree very closely in
every place where the text is compared. The first two are divided into five
books LF agrees with them as to the place where the second book should
begin, but continues it through their third and fourth books, beginning its
third book where they begin their fifth. 'lhen at what is the end of the
treatise in the other codices LF adds a fourth book made up of a hitherto
omitted portion of the first book. OF and MG agree even more closely
than OB, LG, LF, showing a remarkable similarity throughout the entire

collation. Each is written from beginning to end by the same hand. Yet
MG is divided into four books, while OF is carefully arranged into blocks of
a hundred chapters, or centeno, without even the suggestion of a division
