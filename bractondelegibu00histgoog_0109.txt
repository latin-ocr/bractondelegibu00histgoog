PEDIGREE OF THE MANUSCRIPTS

a matter of fact it was never intended for either of these places in the Digby
manuscript, as uo breaks occur at these points. If copied at all it was asa
quire-or two short quires—by itself. The intention of the one responsible
for the making of the codex may have been to put it at the very end of the
treatise, though there is no suggestion of any such arrangement in any of
the other manuscripts.1 It would have been very easy, however, to have
inserted the treatise on Dower aiter quire G in OA. Not only did that quire
end with a discussion of dower in one of its aspecta but the next quire began
at such a point and in such away that the insertion of an extra quire or two
between G and H would in no way have interfered with the working out of
the quire scheme. Whether or not the Action for Dower did occupy that
position iu OA before the quires were bound we have no means of knowing.
The contiguous position of Dower and the text of quires F and G in CB, ML,
LD, LE, would suggest at least the possibility of such an arrangement.e
There are so many manuscripts involved in one phase or another of this
irregularity of order or omission of whole blocks of text that the situation is
very complicated. 'l'here is no direct evidence which will satisfactorily explain
it. Much might be accounted for if we could be sure that OA was only one
of a number of Bractons which were being made at the same time in the same
scriptoriam, or at least under the same management. And indeed it is quite
probable that such was‘ the case. It would seem that more than one set of
manuscripts were copied, at least in part, from the loose quires of the unbound
OA. Seemingly also these loose quires got easily out of order. By the
time that ML, or its exemplar, was copied, three more quires, C, D, Ε, in
haud III, had gotten out of place, and were inserted with the contents of
quires F and G and the Action for Dower aiter chapter XXX, f. 439. We
know that some portions of the unbound OA moved so far away from the rest

¹ At the bottom oi a page in the middle oi quireS in ΟΑ (f. laab) ia this noter “Mittuntur J. de Rello
Prato septem pecias et dimidia subsequentes rubricam istam, videlicet qaod noa ert eapimdo wasidio uapor
matulonam. nt de illis tenetur respondere domino R. de Arundelle. Sequitur continuatio multociens per
recorda bene emtor mentio munionem, et durat titulus usque ad titulum de natione dotis et quaztur aa
constituatur. (See Braetoa aad Aw, 949, u. l.) This note may not refer to OA-in the Digby MS. Dower
does not follow Utrum aa according to this inscription it should-but there is every probability that it does.
From the point at which this note occurs to the eud of the volume there are now only six and oue-half quires.
Aa the last two folios in what ia at present the last quire of ΟΛ are missing we cannot be sure that the
manuscript ended at the same place as the printed text. The additional quire seut to John de Beaupre may
have contained the Action for Dower, which was perhaps put at the end of the trectiseasare fs. bib-118 in
LF. On the other hand, from a note iu the table of contenta which says that the MS. should contsin twenty-
flve quires in addition to the kalendar (it now contains but twenty-three), we might infer that at one time on '
had two short quires on Dower.

¹1t should be noticed that the kalendar of ΟΛ gives the rubrica for the Action for Dower in their
proper place. ln the same way the kalendar of ΟΒ is complete in spite of a laeana in the text.
